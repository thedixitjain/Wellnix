Willett, MD, DrPH Dr. Willett describes a way to eat that is both delicious and healthy. Many nutritional scientists will strongly dispute Dr. Willetts contention that our national symbol of healthy eating, the USDA Food Pyramid, is unhealthy. However, very few will deny that the prescription in this book is a good one. Susan Roberts, Ph.D., senior scientist, Energy Metabolism Laboratory, USDA Human Nutrition Research Center at Tufts University Finally we can step away from the hype and confusion of fad diets and turn instead to a solidly researched guide we know we can trust. I am grateful to Dr. Willett and his associates for making this information so clear and accessible. Throw away your other volumes; this is all you will need. Mollie Katzen, author of The Moosewood Cookbook Willett has studied real women (not rats) over many years in the Nurses Health Study and distilled it into a readable guide for healthy living. This is the book on nutrition every woman should read. Susan Love, M.D., author of Dr. Susan Loves Breast Book and Dr. Susan Loves Hormone Book Eat, Drink, and Be Healthy is a welcome beacon of clarity among the fog of misleading claims that make up the vast majority of diet books on the market.

Dr. Willetts recommendations for healthy eating are based on a sound interpretation of current scientific knowledge, flavored by a joyful appreciation of traditional foodways. Unlike most diet books, he does not emphasize manipulation of one isolated physiological mechanism as a cure-all. Rather, he applies a commonsense interpretation of wide-ranging scientific studies on diet and health. In the process, he challenges widely accepted but poorly supported ideas about nutrition and health, whether they come from the popular press or from federal government committees. The ultimate winners are the readers of this book, who will come away with the tools, guidance, and rationale they need to explore new ways of eating that are delicious, health-promoting, and based on the best of science and tradition.

CHAPTER ONE Healthy Eating Matters YOU EAT TO LIVE. Its a simple, obvious truth. You need food for the basics of everyday lifeto pump blood, move muscles, think thoughts. But what you eat and drink can also help you live well and live longer. By making the right choices, you can avoid some of the things we think of as inevitable penalties of getting older. Eating wellteamed with keeping your weight in the healthy range, exercising regularly, and not smoking can prevent 80 percent of heart attacks, 90 percent of type 2 diabetes, and 70 percent of colorectal cancer.1 It can also help you avoid stroke, osteoporosis, constipation and other digestive woes, cataracts, and aging-related memory loss or dementia.

Making poor dietary choiceseating too much of the wrong kinds of food and too little of the right kinds, or too much food altogethercan send you in the other direction, increasing your chances of developing one or more chronic conditions or dying early. An unhealthy diet during pregnancy can cause some birth defects and may even influence a babys health into adulthood and old age. When it comes to diet, knowing whats good and whats bad isnt always easy. The food industry spends billions of dollars a year to influence your choices, mostly in the wrong direction. Diet gurus promote the latest fads, most of which are less than healthy, while the media serves up near daily helpings of flip-flopping nutrition news. Supermarkets and fast-food restaurants also offer conflicting advice, as do cereal boxes and thousands of websites, blogs, Facebook pages, and tweets. The federal government, through its Food Guide Pyramid, MyPyramid, and MyPlate images, aimed to cut through the confusion but ended up giving misleading and often unhealthy recommendations (see chapter two) that benefit American agriculture and food companies more than Americans health.

While the average American diet still has a long way to go before it can be called healthy, it has improved over the past decade or so in spite of the babel of nutrition information. Several of my colleagues and I looked at the diets of almost 34,000 Americans who took part in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey between 1999 and 2012. This survey, conducted every year, gauges the diet, health, and nutritional status of a sample of adults and children in the United States. We rated the diet of each participant using a tool we developed that assigns higher points to healthy components of the diet, like eating whole grains and unsaturated fats, and lower points to unhealthy components, like eating red meat and drinking sugar-sweetened beverages. The highest score, 110, indicates the healthiest diet possible. We were delighted to report that the quality of the American diet improved between 1999 and 2012.2 Consumption of arterydamaging trans fats declined by 80 or 90 percent, and Americans drank about 25 percent fewer sugar-sweetened beverages. On average, people ate slightly more fruit, whole grains, and healthy unsaturated fats. Our study showed that the average American diet still wasnt very healthyrating 48 points out of 110and that poorer individuals and those with less education have poorer diets than wealthier and better-educated individuals.

Yet, these modest improvements in diet quality had an astounding impact on the health of the nation. Between 1999 and 2012, we estimated that these changes prevented 1.1 million premature deaths from heart attacks, strokes, cancer, and other causes, and 3 million cases of type 2 diabetes. But theres more work to be done, since the average American diet in this study wasnt that great. The eating strategies described in this book will help you make a great diet and reap not only the benefits described in this study but many more as well. SIMPLE STEPS I wrote Eat, Drink, and Be Healthy in 2001 to cut through the confusion about diet. Basing the book on the most reliable scientific evidence available then, I offered recommendations for eating and drinking healthfully. Sixteen years and thousands of scientific papers later, the recommendations in this edition of the book are fundamentally the same, though supported with more extensive evidence and enhanced with important new details. Thats encouraging, because it means that, with careful attention to the types and strength of studies, we can make conclusions about healthy eating that withstand the test of time and deep scientific scrutiny. However, the book needed to be updated, because far too many Americans are still confused about what constitutes a healthy diet and are looking for the best available information.",

Even more encouraging is that national recommendations on healthy eating, called the Dietary Guidelines for Americans,3 have been inching closer to what I advised in 2001 and still advise today. I cant quite rival the brevity of food writer Michael Pollans seven-word dietary credo, Eat food. Not too much. Mostly plants.4 Thats a decent general overview, but it doesnt offer much real guidance. Thats exactly what this book provides. Here is the outline of my simple, actionable advice for healthy eating, which I describe in detail later in the book:  Eat plenty of vegetables and fruits, but limit fruit juices and corn, and hold the potatoes.  Eat more good fats (these mostly come from plants) and fewer bad fats (these mostly come from meat and dairy foods).  Eat more whole-grain carbohydrates and fewer refined-grain carbohydrates.  Choose healthy sources of protein, limit your consumption of red meat, and dont eat processed meat.  Drink more water. Coffee and tea are okay; sugar-sweetened soda and other beverages arent.  Drink alcohol in moderation, if at all.  Take a multivitamin for insurance, just in case you arent getting the vitamins and minerals you need from the foods you eat.

This doesnt mean you must go vegan or vegetarian. Even a partial shift away from a meat-and dairy-centered diet and toward more plant sources of protein is a big step in the direction of long-term good health for you and planet Earth (see chapter twelve). If swearing off meat isnt for you, think about trying the vegan till 6 plan favored by New York Times food writer Mark Bittman. Or experiment with the popular Meatless Monday movement and one day a weekchoosing Monday makes it easy to remember, but it could be any day not eat any meat. While many food experts (Pollan, Bittman, and myself among them) agree with a plant-based diet, the USDA hasnt been entirely on board with it. You can see that in MyPlate, a less-than-healthy infographic the USDA cooked up to summarize the dietary recommendations in the 2010 Dietary Guidelines for Americans (see chapter two). To counter that flawed information, I and several of my colleagues at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, in collaboration with Harvard Health Publications, distilled the best evidence about healthy eating into the Harvard Healthy Eating Plate. This visual, evidence-based guide makes it easy to choose the healthiest options. Its also an important alternative to the USDAs misleading My Plate (see chapter two).",

Aim for color and variety. Keep in mind that potatoes dont count (see The Spud Is a Dud on page 167). THE HARVARD HEALTHY EATING PLATE Figure 1. The Harvard Healthy Eating Plate was created to address deficiencies in the USDAs MyPlate. It provides simple but detailed guidance to help people make the best eating choices.  Go for whole grainsabout one-quarter of your plate. Intact and whole grains, such as whole wheat, barley, wheat berries, quinoa, oats, brown rice, and foods made with them, have a milder effect on blood sugar and insulin than white bread, white rice, and other refined grains (see chapter six).  Choose healthy protein packagesabout one-quarter of your plate. Fish, chicken, beans, soybeans, and nuts are all healthy, versatile protein sources. Limit red meat, and try to stay away from processed meats such as bacon and sausage (see chapter seven).

CHAPTER TWO Of Pyramids, Plates, and Dietary Guidelines THROUGHOUT MOST OF HUMAN HISTORY, the relatively brief life span of our species (during the Roman Empire, the average life expectancy at birth was under thirty years) meant that it didnt much matter what you ate as long as you took in enough calories to survive. Most Romans didnt live long enough for diet-related conditions like heart disease, type 2 diabetes, and cancer to take root. Thats changed. Today the average American lives for nearly eighty years, so what you eat matters as much as how much you eat. We arent born knowing how to choose healthy foods. Most of us need some help, especially in this era when food, food ads, and dietary advice are everywhere. Consider this book as your personal guide for navigating the sea of information, misinformation, and disinformation that surrounds all of us. AN ABUNDANCE OF ADVICE Actually, advice on healthy eating has never been in short supply. More than two thousand years ago, Greek physician and philosopher Hippocrates made diet (and exercise) the centerpiece of good health and the basis for treating disease.

Fast-forward fifteen hundred years and the human life span was increasing. Soon after the invention of the printing press in the mid-1400s, Bartolomeo Platinas De honesta voluptate et valetudine (On Honorable Pleasure and Health) became a bestseller throughout Europe. Aiming to combine health with the pleasure of eating, it melded medical advice with recipes taken from other published works.1 In the 1860s a low-carb diet devised by London undertaker William Banting2 became so wildly successful that the term Banting was used for years in Europe and the United States as a synonym for dieting. Today, hundreds of diet books are published each year, along with innumerable diet-related websites, Facebook pages, and blogs. Much of the advice they offer is misleading or erroneous. Youd think you could turn to the federal government for accurate, safe recommendations about healthy eating. Youd be wrong. OFFICIAL ADVICE The United States government got into the dietary recommendation business in 1894. Thats when the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) published Foods: Nutritive Value and Cost by W. O. Atwater.3 The department continued to churn out a steady stream of recommendations throughout the 1900s.

One was the growing concern about hunger and malnutrition, highlighted in part by the 1968 television broadcast of Hunger in America, a powerful CBS News special report. The other was the growing number of Americans who were developing and dying from cardiovascular disease. In response, Senator George McGovern of South Dakota created the United States Senate Select Committee on Nutrition and Human Needs. In 1977 the committee issued a report called Dietary Goals for the United States (also known as the McGovern Report) that urged Americans to eat less fat, less cholesterol, less refined and processed sugars, and more complex carbohydrates and fiber. That set the stage for the first official Dietary Guidelines for Americans in 1980. According to the USDA, this document provided authoritative advice for people two years and older about how good dietary habits can promote health and reduce risk for major chronic diseases.4 The law authorizing the Dietary Guidelines for Americans fortunately understood that science is an ongoing process and that evidence changes, and so mandated that the guidelines must be revised every five years. Each five-year update starts with the appointment of a scientific advisory committee made up of diet and nutrition experts from around the country. They are charged with reviewing the available data on diet.",

In theory this review should provide an unbiased summary of the scientific evidence. But the beef and dairy industries have worked hard to ensure that some committee members represent their interests. After the committee issues its report, the USDA and the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services work behind closed doors to translate this review into the official guidelines. This leaves open numerous back channels through which economic and political influences can twist and recast the scientific evidence. In the 20152020 update, for example, the advisory committee recommended limiting the consumption of red meat. But the guidelines presented to the American public didnt say that and instead recommended consuming lean meat. What should be a scholarly and scientific process is often a free-for-all among lobbyists for agribusinesses, food companies, and special interest groups. The Dietary Guidelines for Americans are supposed to help us choose foods that will keep us healthy and stay away from those that dont. Unfortunately, their advice has often been murky or downright misleading. The 2010 guidelines, for example, told Americans to avoid solid fats but didnt come out and say that the way to do this was by eating less red meat and dairy foods.

Fast Fact: How the U.S. Constitution Affects Diet I once had lunch in Rome with George McGovern, then the U.S. representative to the World Food Programme, whose work in the U.S. Senate paved the way for the Dietary Guidelines for Americans. He pointed out to me that the U.S. Constitution, by giving every state two senators, is a powerful influence on agriculture policy. The sparsely populated Western states, with large ranching and other agricultural interests, play a disproportional role in Congress, which controls the USDA budget and leadership appointments. Its no wonder that the Dietary Guidelines for Americans, which is inexplicably under the USDAs leadership, dont promote plant-based diets.

THE PYRAMID ARISES IN 1992 THE USDA UNVEILED the influential Food Guide Pyramid. The goal was to make the Dietary Guidelines more accessible. It was built with the help of public relations giant Porter Novelli, whose current and former clients include McDonalds, the Snack Food Association, Krispy Kreme, Johnnie Walker, and Masterfoods USA, maker of MMs. The Food Guide Pyramid was supposed to simply and visually convey the elements of the Dietary Guidelines for Americans, which were inherently flawed. The pyramid highlighted those flaws. It recommended: THE USDAS ORIGINAL FOOD GUIDE PYRAMID Figure 2. USDA Pyramid, 19922005.

It placed good foods, which should be consumed in larger quantities, on the bottom; bad ones, which should be consumed in smaller quantities, on the top; and everything else in between. A pyramid also sends the subliminal message that the advice is rock solid and long-lasting and rises above the jungle of misinformation and contradictory claims. But what the Food Guide Pyramid really offered was wishy-washy, scientifically unfounded advice on an absolutely vital topic what to eat. Some recommendations on diet and nutrition are misguided because they are based on inadequate or incomplete information. That wasnt the case for the USDAs pyramid. Its recommendations were wrong because they ignored solid evidence on healthful eating and aimed to please various food lobbies. The Food Guide Pyramids most health-damaging faults were:  All fats are bad. Wrong: some fats are good for you and are even essential for life (see chapter five). The Food Guide Pyramids recommendation to use fats sparingly helped foster the phobia about fat that led many Americans to throw out the baby with the bathwater.

AN INJECTION OF SCIENCE AND THE CRUMBLING OF THE PYRAMID As soon as the Food Guide Pyramid was unveiled, research from around the globe began to erode it at all levels. Results from scores of large and small studies chipped away at its foundation (carbohydrates), middle (meat and milk), and top (fats). Back in the late 1970s, several colleagues and I realized that there was little solid evidence available on which to base recommendations for healthy eating. We saw an opportunity to change this through the Nurses Health Study (see Praise for Nurses and Health Professionals, page 33) which had been started in 1976 to investigate the long-term consequences of oral contraceptives. A few years later we created a similar long-term study of male health professionals. Thanks to both of these long-term cohort studies, we have been able to follow the eating patterns, lifestyle habits, and health of thousands of women and men for several decades (for more details, see chapter three). The treasure trove of data from this work has let us discover the benefits and harms of different eating patterns and find links between various foods and cancer, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, osteoporosis, and other chronic conditions.

We decided to test whether people who followed the Dietary Guidelines for Americans and its Food Guide Pyramid actually experienced better health and greater life expectancy than those who didnt. To do this, my colleagues and I used the Healthy Eating Index.5 This scale was devised by the USDAs Center for Nutrition Policy and Promotion to measure how well American diets conform to recommended healthy eating patterns. The index assigns scores of 0 to 10 for each of ten dietary components that were the focus of the original Food Guide Pyramid and the 1995 Dietary Guidelines for Americans: the number of daily servings of grains, vegetables (including potatoes), fruits, meat, and dairy products; lower intakes of total fat, saturated fat, dietary cholesterol, and sodium; and variety of the diet. A score of 100 meant perfectly following the USDAs recommendations, while a score of 0 meant totally disregarding them. We extracted information on eating patterns from questionnaires that more than 135,000 female nurses and male health professionals had been completing every four years for more than a decade. Using this information, we calculated a Healthy Eating Index score for each individual.

Take it as a warning that following the Department of Agricultures advice may not help you eat to live well or live longer. A MEDITERRANEAN EXPERIMENT One strand of this evidence came from Greece. In the 1980s, Greek men lived four years longer than American men and had remarkably low rates of heart disease despite a relatively basic health care system. Their diet was thought to have something to do with this. (Note: The term heart disease encompasses a wide range of conditions ranging from chest pain to electrical problems in the heart and failure of the heart muscle to pump blood. In this book, the term heart disease refers to coronary artery disease, which stems from a blockage in one or more arteries that supply blood to the heart.)

Together we created in 1993 a pyramid to represent the traditional Mediterranean diet.7 It was built on a base of healthy whole grains, fruits, vegetables, beans, and healthy fats. At the time it was widely criticized by many in the nutrition community because it was high in fat, mainly olive oil. Since then, various streams of evidence have confirmed that olive oil is a healthy source of calories (see chapter five). Antonia Trichopoulou and her husband, Dimitrios Trichopoulos, the Greek colleagues and friends who helped us create the Mediterranean Diet Pyramid, then embarked on a more formal study of the Greek diet. They created a simple score to describe the traditional eating pattern of Greece. Points were given to higher intakes of olive oil, vegetables, legumes, fruits and nuts, cereal, and fish; lower intakes of meat, poultry, and dairy foods; and moderate alcohol consumption. They tested the score in a population of 22,000 Greek men and women whose diets and health were followed from 1994 to 1999. Those who most closely stuck with a traditional diet were less likely to have died prematurely and to have died from heart disease and cancer.8 Later evaluations of the Mediterranean dietary score in populations around the world have confirmed its correlation with the deve",

After an average of five years, those who had been following the Mediterranean diet had a 30 percent lower rate of cardiovascular disease compared with those in the low-fat group. Further analyses showed that those following the Mediterranean diet also had lower rates of diabetes and breast cancer, and better cognitive function.

That depends on your body size and physical activity. It also didnt describe percentages of calories from fat, carbohydrate, or protein, because there is no scientific basis for setting specific numbers. Also, in reality, it is very difficult for anyone to know if they are exceeding a specific percentage. These changes made the Healthy Eating Pyramid easier to use than the USDA pyramid. There was just one key guideline to remember: Choose more foods from the lower parts of the pyramid than from its upper levels.

One important change from the previous Dietary Guidelines for Americans was the removal of an upper limit for total fat consumption, earlier set at 30 percent and then 35 percent of calories. I congratulate the advisory committee for correctly concluding that there was no evidence to support a specific upper limit. This is an important step, because the caps on total fat in the past led to promoting foods high in carbohydrates that were mostly refined starch and sugar. After reviewing the abundant new evidence, the 20152020 Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee explicitly recommended:  limiting red meat consumption for both individual and planetary health  reducing sugar intake to less than 10 percent of calories  greatly reducing consumption of soda and other sugar-sweetened beverages. The cattle and soda industries were furious about the recommendations. They put their powerful lobbies to work on Capitol Hill. The result was language embedded in the final government appropriations bill that forbade the USDA from including any statements in the final Dietary Guidelines for Americans about the environmental effects of dietary choices. The lobbyists also had a supporter at the USDA, its head, Secretary Tom Vilsack. This former governor of Iowa has longstanding connections to the corn and pork industries.

Even though Congress allowed the USDA to accept the recommendations of the Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee to limit consumption of red and processed meat, the final Dietary Guidelines for Americans didnt mention that. Instead, it promoted consumption of red meat as long as it was lean, a finding not based on any evidence. The clear statement from the Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee about reducing consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages was also considerably watered down. The process of creating the 20152020 Dietary Guidelines vividly exposed the power of the agriculture and food industries in shaping dietary advice. The report of the advisory committee was censored. It was corrupted as it was translated into the official Dietary Guidelines for Americans that form the basis of federal food policy. These are the guidelines that our children learn in school. The 20152020 Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee report was a major advance in bringing advice on healthful eating in line with scientific evidence. But it still left some room for future improvements. The committee was told that its recommendations must meet the recommended dietary allowances (RDAs) for vitamins and minerals set by the Institute of Medicine (now called the National Academy of Medicine). Thats a problem, because RDAs are often based on fragments of evidence and, for some nutrients, are seriously out-of-date.",

Another problem with basing recommendations on RDAs is that the benefits of a food shouldnt be based simply on how much of a single nutrient it contains. This led to recommendations for high consumption of milk, which I discuss in chapters nine and ten. The 20152020 advisory committee followed its predecessors by continuing to include potatoes as a vegetable despite substantial evidence that the health implications of eating potatoes are different than those of eating vegetables (see The Spud Is a Dud on page 167). Some experts challenged the advisory committees decision to deemphasize the importance of limiting dietary cholesterol and eggs, a matter of judgment that I will talk about in chapter five. That said, the committee deserves much credit for producing the most scientifically based report so far. Its highly unfortunate that their evidence-based recommendations werent faithfully translated in the final dietary guidelines that guide policy and shape the eating habits of millions of Americans. FURTHER TESTING OF THE PYRAMIDS, PLATES, AND DIETARY GUIDELINES Back in 1995 the USDA created what it called the Healthy Eating Index.

My colleagues and I, having highlighted the deep flaws in the USDAs dietary recommendations, put the Healthy Eating Index to the test among the participants of the Nurses Health Study and the Health Professionals studies. Individuals with high scores were only slightly less likely to have had heart attacks or strokes, and there was no reduction in cancer. In other words, those who most closely followed the governments recommendations didnt fare much better than those who did. What if such a diet-measuring tool made a distinction between healthful unsaturated fat and less-than-healthy saturated fat, or the main sources of carbohydrates or protein? So we devised the Alternate Healthy Eating Index in 2002.12 It recorded nine diet items: servings of vegetables, fruits, and nuts or soy protein a day; grams of fiber from grains; the ratio of white to red meat; the amount of trans fat; the ratio of polyunsaturated to saturated fat; use of a multivitamin; and daily alcohol consumption.

New evidence on diet and health prompted my colleagues and me to make small adjustments to our Alternative Healthy Eating Index. With the most recent update, in 2010, we added to the index, limiting soda and other sugar-sweetened beverages as a healthy eating strategy. We repeated our test to determine if women and men whose diets fit the pattern described by this indexwhich matches the recommendations in this bookhave better long-term health and compared it to an updated version of the USDAs Healthy Eating Index that more closely resembles our Alternative Index.

This convergence of evidence from many different sources makes me confident that what I recommend in this book will help you choose a diet that is healthy for a lifetime. Despite a few naysayers who contend that nutrition scientists cant agree on anything,15 the convergence of Harvards Alternative Healthy Eating Index and the USDAs Healthy Eating Index suggest that a broad consensus has developed around the basic elements of a healthy diet.

For example, new findings about the health effects of vegetables in chapter eight are likely to surprise many readers.

Curious about other potentially healthy changes in the American diet, my colleagues and I applied the Alternative Healthy Eating Index to the eating patterns of a national survey of Americans. We saw steady improvements between 1999 and 2012. The changes with the biggest effects on health were the near elimination of artery-damaging trans fats and a 25 percent drop in drinking sugar-sweetened soda. There were also modest increases in eating fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and unsaturated fat.16 We estimated that these improvements in diet had prevented more than 1 million premature deaths and 12 percent of cases of diabetes between 1999 and 2012. Shortly after our report, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported that new diagnoses of diabetes had declined for the first time, by a substantial 20 percent, consistent with reductions in trans fat and soda consumption. Although the trend in diet quality was in the right direction, the average score was still less than 50 on a scale of 110, indicating the potential for far greater improvements in health.

RESEARCH ABOUT DIET AND NUTRITION seems to contradict itself with aggravating regularity. You stop using butter and start spreading margarine on your toast, only to learn later that margarine can be as bad for you, and then later that butter isnt as bad as it was once thought to be. After switching to bran muffins for breakfast because high-fiber diets supposedly prevent colon cancer, you hear about a big study showing that fiber doesnt prevent colon cancer. In an early study, coffee drinking appeared to increase the chances of developing pancreatic cancer, while later research shows that coffee drinking is harmless and may even have some benefits. Some studies find that eating fish prevents heart attacks; others dont. These flipflops are so confusing and so common that a negative report on vitamin E and betacarotene once goaded Boston Globe columnist Ellen Goodman to write, There seems to be some sort of planned obsolescence now to medical news. Todays cure is tomorrows poison pellet. Fresh research has a sell-by date that is shorter than the one on the cereal box.1 The sheer volume of information doesnt help.

Its only natural that people want to know the latest (often confused with the best) results, whether they are looking for ways to fine-tune their diets or for that single magic keythe right food or vitamin or supplementthat will open the door to the longest, healthiest life possible. The media cater to this interest and serve up a steady stream of nutrition news. The problem is that newspapers, television, radio, blogs, websites, and apps tend to turn the baby steps of scientific research into major advances, breakthroughs, and possible cures, or highlight the confusing contradictions when one study contradicts an earlier one. This makes following health news seem like reading pages torn at random from a book or, worse, reading the pages with misprints. REPLACING EDUCATED GUESSES WITH EVIDENCE Another reason for the flip-flops is that early recommendations about diet were often based on thin evidence. The thinking behind these early recommendations was that, since people were going to eat no matter what, guidelines based on intelligent guesses were better than no guidelines at all.

Unfortunately, these recommendations never carried warning labels like Educated Guess, Subject to Change. Those educated guesses tend to be repeated thousands of times until they acquire the ring of truth. When researchers began learning of the possible dangers of saturated fat, for example, many recommended that people switch from butter, which is high in saturated fat, to low-saturated-fat margarine. This recommendation made sense, even though there were no studies showing that people who ate margarine instead of butter had fewer heart attacks. Then along came studies showing that margarine eaters fared worse in the heart-attack department than butter eaters. That finding was reinforced by short-term studies showing that trans fat, which was high in many margarines, had far worse effects on blood cholesterol than saturated fat. To a scientist, this is the normal path of scientific progressa recommendation based on a good guess is tested and toppled by one based on better science. To the rest of the world, though, it is a frustrating contradiction. The amount and quality of sound scientific information on diet and health have grown enormously over the past thirty years.

Thats partly because the media pay special attention to nutritionbecause of the publics interestwhile inorganic chemistry, geology, and many other disciplines escape this daily scrutiny. Its also because medical science has its own special rhythm, one that doesnt fit with the medias need to tell compelling but simple stories. Efforts to present balanced articles by quoting opposing views can sometimes confuse things even further. For nutrition research, the rhythm is more a cha-chatwo steps forward and one step backthan a straight-ahead march. If you look at the day-to-day results, which are reported more like sports scores than scientific research, its easy to wonder why researchers cant get it right the first time.

WORKING WITH REAL PEOPLE POSES SPECIAL CHALLENGES Nutrition scientists usually cant exert the same kind of control over their research subjects that chemists and zoologists can. Instead they must work with unpredictable, independent, mostly uncontrollable subjects: people. Here are a few of the challenges that nutrition researchers face:  People dont eat human chow meal after meal after meal. Instead, diets change from day to day, week to week, and season to season. What you usually eat now is probably a bit (or maybe a lot) different from what you used to eat two years ago or will eat two years from now. These changes are driven by personal taste, cultural changes, new developments in agriculture and technology, and changes in work and family life. Disease and aging can also change what people eat.  Many studies depend on people accurately reporting what they eat. Thats a challenging task: Try remembering exactly what you ate one day last week.

So far weve figured out what only a small percentage of them do in the body. And then there are the artificial compounds added as preservatives, stabilizers, flavor enhancers, and more. This makes it difficult to draw strong conclusions about a specific vitamin, mineral, or other molecule from studies of foods and diseases. Knowing exactly what is in different foods, how food compounds interact, and what they all do in the body are important jobs for the future.  Calculating the nutrients a person gets from the foods she or he eatshow much saturated fat, fiber, vitamin E, and so onis tricky, since it depends on sometimes sketchy information about food composition.  Almost everyone eats some fat, fiber, sugar, starches, fruits, vegetables, vitamins, and so forth.

In these carefully controlled studies, half of a group of volunteers is randomly assigned to the experimental diet or treatment, and the other half is assigned to a comparison diet or treatment (called the control) or possibly to no treatment at all. After a preset time, the number of people in the experimental group who have developed the predetermined endpointdeath, heart attack, broken hip, and so onis compared with the number in the control group. For example, say you want to know if vitamin C prevents age-related memory loss. You would round up a large group of volunteers, then randomly assign some to take a daily vitamin C tablet, while the others take an identical tablet that contains an inactive ingredient that tastes like vitamin C (a placebo).

So the only thing different between the two groups is the diet or treatment. Unfortunately, randomized trials are often impossible to do when it comes to nutrition. Getting people to prepare and eat special meals for a long time is difficult. So is getting people to take a vitamin pill or placebo for maybe a decade or more. Given the large number of volunteers needed, the cost of running a randomized trial can be astronomical. The Womens Health Initiativewhich tested the effect of reducing dietary fat to 20 percent of calories and increasing consumption of fruits and vegetables on the development of breast cancer, heart disease, and other chronic conditions among almost 60,000 women in the 1990s cost more than 2 billion and didnt yield clear answers on this important question, in part because there was actually very little difference in fat intake between women assigned to follow a low-fat diet and those following the comparison usual diet.

But a trial conducted in China, where folic acid levels were low, found an important reduction in strokes.3 This makes it likely that at least some people in the U.S. with low folic acid intake would also benefit from getting more of this vitamin. The ability of randomized trials to give misleading results is vividly illustrated by their failure to detect a benefit in stopping smoking, probably the single most important step a person can take to improve their health.4 This happened in a classic trial called the Multiple Risk Factor Intervention Trial. The reason it didnt detect a benefit for quitting smoking is almost surely because many of the participants who stopped smoking took it up again, and the seven-year study wasnt long enough to see the full benefits for those who did quit permanently.

The group is then followed for a period of time, ideally a decade or more, either directly with occasional checkups and mailed questionnaires or indirectly by monitoring death certificates. Once the study has gone on long enough, researchers can examine the accumulated information to test a variety of hypotheses. They can, for example, determine if people in the cohort who eat the most fiber have different rates of colon cancer from those who eat the least fiber, or if those who consume the most folate, an important B vitamin, have lower rates of heart disease than those who consume the least folate. Such long-term studies have yielded some of the best insights so far into the link between diet and health.

Randomized controlled trials are sometimes held up as the best evidence. But cohort studies can answer questions that arent possible in such trials, such as longterm effects of diet.

They then compare the two groups for differences in diet, exercise, or whatever variable they are interested in. Case-control studies are effective tools when the variable is clear-cutsay, cigarette smoking or occupation.

Controlled Feeding Studies These are a kind of short-term randomized trial done with volunteers, sometimes living in special clinic wards, who eat specially prepared meals. The controlled conditions make it possible to see how different foods or nutrients affect changes in blood cholesterol or other biochemical markers. But these studies are too small and dont go on long enough to measure the effect on disease risks. Nor can they measure how real diets affect people living in the far messier and less controlled real world. Praise for Nurses and Health Professionals Back in 1976, Dr. Frank Speizer at the Channing Laboratory of Brigham and Womens Hospital and the Harvard School of Public Health started the Nurses Health Study. Its initial aim was to investigate the potential long-term consequences of oral contraceptives, which were then being taken by millions of women. Nurses were chosen as the study population because of their knowledge about health and their ability to provide complete and accurate information about various diseases, thanks to their nursing education.

The participants complete follow-up questionnaires every two years to update information on a variety of health risk factors, and they complete diet questionnaires every four years. Former secretary of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Donna Shalala called the Nurses Health Study one of the most significant studies ever conducted on the health of women. To recognize the fortieth anniversary of this study, the American Journal of Public Health devoted a whole issue to recount its many contributions.5 More studies are under way.

This book reflects their time and effort. Ecological Studies Much of the motivation for research on diet and health, and some of the early clues about what might be important, have come from studies that compare diets and disease rates in various geographical areas. One of the seminal ecological studies was the Seven Countries Study, conducted by Dr. Ancel Keys and colleagues in the 1960s. These investigators enrolled about 1,000 men in fourteen different areas in seven countries and followed them for a decade to document their rates of heart attacks. They documented about a tenfold difference in rates of heart disease, with the lowest being on the Greek island of Crete and in Japan. Keys and colleagues also showed that, among the fourteen areas, there was a correlation between intake of saturated fat and heart disease rates.6 At the same time, other scientists were showing that men who migrated from areas like Japan, where heart disease rates were low, to the United States, where they were high, were more likely to develop heart disease than men who stayed put.",

These findings were profoundly important because they clearly showed that the high heart disease rates of the U.S. were not due to genetic factors and were not inevitable. The central weakness of ecological studies is that many factors other than diet often differ between geographic regions. In the Seven Countries Study it wasnt possible to conclude that saturated fat was the key cause of heart disease. Clearly more research was needed, but evidence from these ecological studies provided the impetus to look at diet because, in principle, all populations might have been able to achieve the low rates of heart disease seen in Crete even without sophisticated medicine. In parallel with the work of Keys and colleagues, other scientists were conducting ecological studies of breast and other major cancers. Similar findings emerged: large differences in rates from country to country, an increase in the breast cancer rate seen with migration to the U.S., and strong correlations with dietary factors. Mendelian Randomization Studies This approach, named after Gregor Mendel, the nineteenth-century monk known as the father of genetics, is a newcomer to study designs.

A systematic review combs through the medical literature to identify all the relevant studies and then offers conclusions based on them. A meta-analysis statistically combines the published results from a systematic review to provide an overall bottom line. One problem with meta-analyses is that they gather data only from published studies and so cant capture information from negative studies, which tend not to get published. Another is that almost anyone with a computer and Internet connection can do a meta-analysis. But to be done well for a complicated topic like diet and health, deep knowledge of the topic is also required. For example, investigators who conducted a headline-grabbing meta-analysis concluding that replacing saturated fat with unsaturated fat had no benefit for heart disease risk7 were clearly unfamiliar with the published literature, the design of the studies they included, and even the definition of the dietary variables that they used.",

Pooled analyses also have their limits, as they are only as strong as the studies included. To combine studies, it is usually necessary to use only the variables that were included in all of the studies, such as just a single baseline assessment of diet. DECIPHERING MEDICAL NEWS Careful journalists try to put new research into perspective. But its impossible to cram that kind of context into thirty seconds of air time or 250 words, so you often end up with little more than sound bites or headlines. Other than mastering the fine points of nutrition research, here are a few tips that can help you know what nutrition news is worth paying attention to:  Studies done on people. How foods, nutrients, and food additives affect mice, dogs, and monkeys is an important thread in the fabric of nutrition research. But they may have completely different effects on people.

Studies that look at diseases, not markers for them. Because it takes so long for chronic diseases to develop, many studies use intermediate markers like narrowing of the hearts arteries or changes in bone density as standins. These changes dont necessarily translate into real diseases, though. Pay more attention to research that has looked at real health problems like broken bones or heart attacks.  Large studies. In science, the play of chance is a real problem. The larger the study, the smaller the possibility that chance alone explains potentially important differences between two groups.

(The courtroom is an example of a situation in which important decisions, some of them literally matters of life or death, are made without randomized trials.) In diet and health, when data from randomized trials arent available or feasible, the best evidence often comes when a link is seen between a dietary factor and disease in multiple well-designed cohort studies and controlled feeding studies. As described in chapter five, this is how trans fat was convicted for increasing the risk of heart disease. A good example of consistent evidence is the link between moderate alcohol use and reduced risk of heart disease. Possible beneficial effects of alcohol have been suspected for more than two thousand years. In the late 1700s, William Heberden, the British physician who first described the chest pain known today as angina, wrote that wine and spiritous liquorsafford considerable relief from angina.8 Sporadic reports appeared throughout the twentieth century suggesting that drinking alcohol prevented clogged arteries, but they were often balanced by reports of the detrimental effects of heavy drinking.

These observations have been further bolstered by evidence from laboratory, animal, and controlled feeding studies in humans showing that alcohol increases levels of protective HDL cholesterol and also makes blood less likely to clot, both of which would be expected to protect against heart disease. Using a Mendelian randomization approach, a genetic variant involved in metabolizing alcohol was shown to be associated with heart attack risk, and only in those consuming alcohol.10 This body of evidence points to a firm conclusion that drinking moderate amounts of alcohol reduces the risk of heart disease. A randomized trial just getting under way as this book goes to press should offer even more information about the benefits and risks of drinking alcohol. Regardless of the results from all of these different streams of evidence, any decision about drinking should take into account alcohols full range of risks and benefits (see chapter nine).

More than one-third of American adults now fall into this category, almost triple the proportion from the early 1960s.3 Obesity among children has also increased dramatically over this period by three-to fourfold, an alarming trend given that early obesity leads to diabetes and cardiovascular disease at a young age. Although the percentage of children with obesity has leveled off in recent years, the number of children with it remains dangerously high. As a nation, we spend more than 200 billion a year4 on medical care for obesity and its complications. The situation isnt much better elsewhere around the globe.

First, a weight that may be perfectly fine for someone who is six feet onesay 175 poundsis way too much for someone who is five feet two. Another part is lingering confusion about the way healthy weight has been defined in the past. A number called the body mass index (BMI), or Quetelet index, gets around the first problem. This measure of weight adjusted for height does a good job of accounting for the fact that taller people tend to weigh more than shorter people. If you like math, you can calculate your BMI like this: Divide your weight in pounds by your height in inches; divide that number by your height in inches; and multiply that number by 703. You can also just look it up in the table on page 41 or have it calculated for you by any number of online BMI calculators, such as the one on the Harvard Health Publications website (www.health.harvard.edubmi). Setting guidelines for healthy BMIs has traditionally been done by examining death rates in large groups of people and then picking the BMIs with the lowest death rates as the healthy range.

The problem with the study, and similar ones that came before it, is that they included smokers and people who were chronically ill but didnt fully account for the effects of these. Cigarette smokers tend to be leaner than nonsmokers, in part because smoking blunts the appetite. People who smoke heavily are likely to be leaner than light smokers. Because smoking is such a powerful risk factor for death, this will tend to make being lean look unhealthy. Also, in any large population, the leanest people are a mix of a small number of thin people who have managed to strike a long-term balance between the number of calories they take in and the number they burn plus people who are thin because they have illnesses that are accompanied by weight loss (such as cancer, heart disease, emphysema, and frailty in the elderly). In other words, low weights dont necessarily cause premature death but are instead often the result of diagnosed or undiagnosed illnesses that eventually will be fatal. These confounding factors make the leaner group appear to be more likely to die prematurely. By comparison, then, the overweight group will appear to be less likely to die prematurely. Two strategies can sidestep these limitations: (1) Look only at nonsmokers. (2) Ignore in the data crunching any deaths that occur during the first few years of follow-up to eliminate individuals with previously undiagnosed cancer or other conditions that would have accounted for their low weight.",

During a follow-up period averaging fifteen years, we saw that the lowest death rates were among people with BMIs between 18.5 and 24.9, much as we had expected.7 Among those with BMIs above 25, the greater the weight, the greater was the risk of dying during the study period. The relation between weight and mortality was similar across all geographic regions of the world. Another 2016 meta-analysis that included more than 30 million people8 concluded the same thing. CURRENT WEIGHT GUIDELINES CAN BE TOO GENEROUS The 20152020 Dietary Guidelines for Americans sets healthy weights as those corresponding to BMIs between 18.5 and 25. BMIs above 25 are labeled as unhealthy (see Figure 9). In choosing these limits, the Scientific Advisory Committee for the 20152010 Dietary Guidelines for Americans tried to balance scientific evidence with public policy and perception.

But they didnt feel justified choosing such a low number as the cutoff between healthy and unhealthy weights, because doing so would have labeled a large majority of the U.S. population as overweight. Instead they chose a BMI of 25 as the upper bound of healthy weights, based on clear evidence that the risk of dying prematurely increases above that point. (The guidelines committee didnt include the 2013 CDC study I described earlier see page 42). That means almost everyone with a BMI over 25except for extremely muscular bodybuilderswould be healthier with a lower BMI, but many people with a BMI of 23 to 25 are not at their healthiest weight. Still, drawing the line at 25 means that two-thirds of adult Americans are overweight or obese. Figure 9.

KEEP YOUR BMI IN THE HEALTHY RANGE Heres the bottom line on BMI: If your weight corresponds with a BMI below 25, do all you can to keep it there by healthy eating and exercising. More specifically, try to keep from gaining weight, even if you could add some pounds and still stay within the healthy BMI range. If your weight corresponds to a BMI above 25, you will do yourself a huge health favor by keeping it from increasing and, if possible, by trying to bring it down. If you inhabit the low end of the BMI curve and your weight hasnt changed, great.

For clothing designers, its the narrowest part of the torso. For scientists studying the health effects of body fat, its the region near the navel, where fat is typically deposited. The best way to measure your waist size is with the same two-step process used by researchers with the ongoing National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey: (1) Gently press your right hip bone to find its high point. (2) Place a tape measure just above that point and wrap the tape around your abdomen, keeping it parallel to the floor (see Figure 10). For most people, the top of the hip bone is generally in line with the navel. Others may need to pull the tape down a bit to the top of the hip bone.

A waist size of 35 inches for women and 40 inches for men is a worrisome signal. As is the case with weight, its better to take action if your waist is increasing before you reach these limits. Some researchers advocate calculating a waist-to-hip ratio. That means dividing the size of your waist by the size of your hips. A waist-to-hip ratio greater than 0.90 for men and 0.85 for women can indicate the potential for health problems. But simply measuring your waist is probably just as useful. Many studies have shown that this single number is just as powerful at gauging the chances of developing chronic disease as the waist-to-hip ratio. Its also a lot easier to do. Figure 10.

If you read diet books or keep up with health and nutrition news, youve probably heard a lot about fat calories or carbohydrate calories. The idea that fat calories are different from carbohydrate calories came from studies done under extreme conditions, such as consuming pure carbohydrate, protein, or fat. In these situations, the body converts dietary fat to body fat a bit more efficiently than it does carbohydrate or protein. In a normal diet, though, your body converts all carbohydrate, fat, and protein to energy at the same rate. When it comes just to generating energy, a calorie is a calorie. (Calories from trans fat may be an exception; more on that later.) This calorie blindness is the result of a neat solution to a vexing problem faced by some of earths early inhabitants: how to run a body on different fuels. Instead of having completely different intracellular systems for fats, carbohydrates, protein, alcohol, and the like, the cells in your body use one of two energy sources: glucose and fat. Much of what you eat is (or can be if needed) converted to the energy coin of the realm, a six-carbon sugar called glucose.

If glucose is like cash in your pocket, ready to be spent when needed, glycogen is money in the bank, available with a bit of effort, and fat is money tied up in stocks or mutual funds. However, the conversion of glucose to fat is a one-way street: fat cant be converted back to glucose. So while your cells typically run on glucose, when there isnt enough, you can switch over to burning fats, either directly from the fat you eat or by withdrawing fat from storage in your body. Brain cells are an exception: they run on glucose only. CALORIE QUALITY MATTERS TOO While a calorie is ultimately a calorie on the cellular level, the foods you eat for calories can have an important effect on your health. The source of calories can influence how satisfied you feel after eating. Some foods, like an apple, can fill your stomach and leave you content for hours, while a can of soda with twice the calories will hardly ease your hunger.

Another way in which calories may differ is highlighted in the book Always Hungry? by my colleague David Ludwig. He highlights a longstanding paradox: some people have hundreds of thousands of surplus calories stored as body fat and yet can be just as hungry as thin people. How is it that overweight and obese individuals arent able to draw from their stored calories when they are hungry instead of eating more? Ludwig offers evidence that a higher insulin level, stimulated mainly by eating rapidly digested and absorbed carbohydrates, is a key metabolic signal that shunts calories into storage as fat and keeps those calories locked up and inaccessible. That provides a rationale for following a diet with a lower glycemic load, which I describe in chapter six. While carrying too many pounds is a key threat to health, its important not to lose sight of the fact that diet affects health in many ways that arent related to weight. Those need to be factored into planning a diet for long-term weight control.

LOW-FAT DIETS ARENT THE ANSWER A common though absolutely false thread that runs through many diets is the idea that fat in food makes fat in the body. Limit fat calories, so the thinking goes, and youll be able to control your weight. Although theres a pleasant symmetry to that logic, theres no good evidence linking dietary fat with excess weight. In fact, theres plenty of evidence showing that a higher percentage of calories from fat doesnt lead to gaining weight or being overweight and the evidence is tending in the opposite direction. Thats why the Harvard Healthy Eating Pyramid and Healthy Eating Plate dont ban fats. Instead, they treat fats as important nutritional factors in your diet. I cover what fats to choose and how much to eat in chapter five. To be sure, some countries with high fat intake have many overweight people. In the United States, for example, the average person gets about one-third of his or her daily calories from fat (a relatively high percentage), and almost two-thirds of the population is overweight or obese. But not long ago in parts of South Africa, where 60 percent of people were overweight, fat contributed barely one-quarter of calories. In other words, factors other than dietary fat influence overweight and obesity. I am not trying to absolve dietary fat or downplay its potential contributions to weight or weight gain. Dietary fat affects energy, fat stores, and weight.",

But there is no evidence that calories from fat contribute more to weight gain than calories from carbohydrates or other sources. But if you balance the number of calories you eat with the number of calories you burn, especially if part of the burn comes from exercise, then you wont gain weight on a diet that has 35 percent, 40 percent, or more calories from fat. And if you are eating the right kinds of fat, you will help protect yourself from heart disease and other chronic conditions. A LOW-CARB DIET MAY HELP For years, mainstream nutrition experts dismissed Dr. Robert Atkinss carbohydrate-shunning diet as an unhealthy fad. How in the world could a highprotein, high-fat, low-carbohydrate diet help with weight loss when everyone knew that fat was a dietary demon? Once the Atkins diet got its day in courtthe court of careful scientific testingthe good doctor was proven to have a decent case, at least in part. The low-carb idea isnt new. In the mid-1800s, the aforementioned William Banting, an obese British undertaker, happened on a low-carbohydrate diet. He tried it for a few months and watched with delight as the pounds slipped away without the gnawing hunger and cravings that other diets had caused him.

Low-carb diets like the Atkins diet seem to be easier to stick with than low-fat diets and, contrary to experts warnings, generally dont cause harmful changes in blood cholesterol even when they contain fairly high amounts of fat, although that depends on the type and source of fat.

This probably isnt an issue for most people, but it may pose problems for those with mild kidney disease. People with high blood pressure are often in this category. But eating unlimited amounts of beef, sausage, butter, and cheese, as promoted by the original Atkins diet, isnt a good idea for overall good health. There are better ways to cut back on unhealthy carbs. Eating more nuts, beans, soy foods, fish, poultry, nonstarchy fruits and vegetables, whole grains, and vegetable oils, as recommended by the Healthy Eating Pyramid and Healthy Eating Plate, can work for weight control even as it reduces the risks of heart disease, diabetes, and several cancers. Even Atkins was heading in that direction before his untimely death in 2003, as his final book had shifted toward this version of a low-carbohydrate diet.

Easily digested foods that cause sharp spikes in blood sugar also stimulate a matching production of insulin. The more insulin dumped into the bloodstream, the faster glucose is removed. A sudden drop in glucose, along with other hormonal changes, generates new hunger signals. In an elegant study involving a dozen overweight boys at Boston Childrens Hospital, those who ate specially prepared breakfasts enriched with easily digested carbohydrates snacked almost twice as much during the morning as those who ate breakfasts that delivered the same number of calories but included more slowly digested carbohydrates.17 The glycemic index and glycemic load (see page 118) measure how different foods affect blood sugar. People with diabetes have been using the glycemic index and glycemic load for years to plan meals and snacks that cause the smallest possible increases in blood sugar.

ENERGY DENSITY ISNT A RELIABLE GUIDE Several popular diet books claim foods that deliver relatively few calories per mouthful, like soup or baked squash, fill you up faster than foods that pack more calories, like meat or nuts, and so help you lose weight. This concept is called energy density. Apples, potatoes, cooked rice, and lettuce have low energy densities, largely because they are mostly water. Nuts, bagels, cookies, Wasa bread, and other dry, high-fiber foods have high energy densities. As a concept, energy density doesnt necessary help when it comes to dieting. Some foods with low energy densities, like white bread and white potatoes, do nothing for weight loss and plenty for weight gain, while some high-energy-density foods, like nuts and olive oil, can help control weight. The strongest evidence against using energy density to control weight comes from the PREDIMED trial I mentioned earlier.

My colleagues and I looked at consumption of specific foods in relation to changes in weight over twenty-four years among 120,877 women and men in these cohorts who were not initially overweight.18 The foods linked to greater weight gain included:  soda (overall, the most important food or beverage for weight gain because it was consumed so often)  potatoes in all forms  red meat  refined grains  sweets  fruit juice. Foods related to less weight gain included:  vegetables  fruits  whole grains  nuts  yogurt. Milk (both whole and low-fat) and diet soda werent appreciably linked to weight gain. Unless you believe in magic, it shouldnt come as a surprise that no single food or beverage accounted for a large change in weight.

In this trial, 322 moderately obese men and women were randomly assigned to one of three diets: a low-fat diet with about 1,500 calories a day for women and 1,800 a day for men; a Mediterranean-type diet with the same calorie targets; and a low-carbohydrate diet with no calorie target but an aim to provide only 20 grams of carbohydrate a day for the first two months, then gradually increasing to a maximum of 120 grams a day. Among the participants who finished the two-year trial, those who followed the low-fat diet lost an average of 7 pounds, those following the Mediterranean diet lost about 10 pounds, and those on the low-carb diet lost 12 pounds. The healthiest changes in cholesterol levels were seen in the low-carb and Mediterranean groups, while the healthiest change in blood sugar was seen in the Mediterranean group.19 When the researchers checked in with the participants four years after the trial had stopped, those originally in the low-fat group had regained all the weight they had lost, while those in the Mediterranean-diet group had maintained their wei",

THREE STEPS TO WEIGHT CONTROL Given how easy it is to add a few pounds here and there, and the food temptations that bombard us, how can you avoid gaining weight or lose weight if you need to? I recommend this three-pronged strategy: 1. If you arent physically active, get moving. If you are, try to be even more active. 2. Find an eating strategy that works for you. Those offered in this book are a great place to start. 3. Become a mindful and defensive eater. I wish I could give you a more precise set of instructions guaranteed to control weight. But I cantand I dont think anyone else can, either. Chalk that up to the wonderful diversity of the human race. People are as unique as snowflakes.

When you walk, run, swim, lift weights, dance, play tennis, clean the house, or do anything active, your muscles burn even more calories. Physical activity stimulates muscle cells to grow and divide, prompting them to grow in strength and size. The more muscle you have, the more calories you burn, even at rest. Without exercise, fat replaces muscle. If you dont exercise, your muscles gradually waste away. Its the same kind of atrophy that occurs when you wear a cast on an arm or leg only stretched out over years rather than weeks, so its impossible to feel or see. The less muscle you have, the less energy your body uses at rest and the easier it is to gain weight. To make matters worse, lost muscle is usually replaced by fat (see Figure 11). This starts a vicious and tough-to-break cycle. For a fifty-year-old person who isnt physically active, a 10-pound weight gain over the years may really mean a loss of 5 pounds of muscle and gain of 15 pounds of fat. Unlike muscle, fat uses little glucose and burns few calories. As the balance between muscle and fat shifts further and further in favor of fat, resting metabolism slows even more.

A colleague of mine once saw her physician for one of those big birthday physical exams. Everything was fine, with one exception: her blood pressure was too high. When her doctor told her she needed to lose 30 pounds or so to get her pressure under control, she shot back, Where were you when I was putting on those pounds? Its a great question. The physical and physiological changes wrought by decreased muscle mass and increased weight are tough to reverse and in some cases may be irreversible. Ounces of prevention are better than pounds of cure. It is easier to prevent weight gain than it is to lose weight. In fact, gaining weight makes your body more receptive to future weight gain and makes getting rid of extra pounds doubly difficult. To make matters worse, some of the effects of excess weight, such as diabetes, heart disease, or stroke, may not fully disappear even with successful weight loss. Figure 11.

Walk for health. Experts once thought that we needed vigorous exercise to keep the heart and circulatory system in shape. Not so. Brisk walking offers many of the same benefits as sweating it out in a noisy gym or jogging through your neighborhood. For many people, walking is an excellent type of physical activity because it doesnt require any special equipment, can be done anytime and anyplace, and is generally quite safe. More vigorous exercise, such as running or bicycling, lets you pack the same cardiovascular workout into a shorter period and also gives you a higher level of physical fitness. Although activities more vigorous than brisk walking may provide some added benefits, you can achieve much in the way of chronic disease prevention with a good daily walk.

Most recommendations translate this into time: thirty minutes of physical activity on most, if not all, days of the week. There is no question that this much activity is far better than inactivity. Fast Fact: What, Exactly, Is Brisk? The pace described as brisk means walking quickly enough so your heartbeat and breathing speed up, but not so fast that you cant carry on a normal conversation. Its moving as if you were late for an important meeting. If you are a counter or measurer, brisk walking is taking around one hundred steps a minute or walking at a clip of three to four miles per hour.

These differences, which are probably due to a combination of genetic, environmental, and psychological or social factors, are actually good news. It shows that there is a route for just about everyone who wants to lose weight. Individual differences are one reason why this book doesnt define healthy eating by a rigid breakdown of calories into percentages from protein, carbohydrate, and fat. Instead, we provide a variety of information to help you find the best program for you. If you are one of the lucky folks who have successfully controlled weight with the first diet you tried, thank your genes, your psyche, and your family. But if you try a diet and it doesnt work, dont give up! It may not have been right for your metabolism, eating habits, or social situation. Experiment with other weight control strategies as long as they emphasize healthy sources of fat, carbohydrate, and protein and include regular physical activity. You should be able to find the one thats right for you. Diets low in refined carbohydrates often work best. For years weve been hearing that low-fat diets rich in carbohydrates are the best route to weight loss and improved cardiovascular fitness.

For others, too many carbohydrates promote weight gain. The Atkins, South Beach, Dukan, and other low-carb diets ask you to take drastic measures, at least at first, and stop eating virtually all carbohydrates. As long as you arent gobbling no-or low-carb foods packed with saturated and trans fats, limiting or eliminating refined carbohydrates is a good step to take. Keep in mind, though, that crash diets overemphasize short-term weight loss when the real goal should be finding a healthy eating pattern that can help you control your weight for years. The strategies described in this book are aimed at exactly that. Giving up refined carbohydrates in favor of whole grains, vegetables, fruits, and healthy sources of protein and fat will reduce the spikes of glucose and insulin that provoke hunger while also supplying important vitamins, minerals, fiber, and other phytonutrients. Making that switch can also reduce your chances of developing high blood pressure, type 2 diabetes, or heart disease. Cutting out trans fats, cutting back on saturated fats, and getting more monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats can improve your cholesterol levels, prevent blood clots, allow your arteries to work more effectively, and boost your muscles response to insulin.",

Choose a healthy global diet. An eating plan that borrows heavily from the Mediterranean and other traditional diets offers a healthy nutritional foundation. Plenty of vegetables, moderate amounts of intact and whole grains, and relatively little red meat can help you feel satisfied on fewer calories. The abundance of vegetables and whole grains, as well as the relatively high percentage of fat (30 percent or more of calories, mainly from olive and other vegetable oils), make for mild effects on blood sugar. Just as important, these kinds of diets are open to creative interpretation. You can incorporate cuisines from around the world, as well as your own creations, into an eating pattern with enough variety and pleasure to last a lifetime. 3.

Here are some suggestions that can help you be a defensive eater: Practice stopping before you are stuffed. Recognize that we are victims of our culture, one that glorifies excess. Be selective. Dont eat just because food is put in front of you. Choose small portions when eating out. Restaurant portions are often oversized and a single meal can deliver a whole days worth of calories. Think about sharing entr\u00e9es, or order two appetizers instead of an entr\u00e9e. Slow down and pay attention to your food when you eat. When you wolf down food, you effectively bypass the intricate set of Im full signals that your digestive system is designed to generate. Eating at a moderate pace gives your stomach and intestines time to send these messages to your brain and for your brain to respond to them. Beware of desserts. A single slice of the Cheesecake Factorys Original cheesecake packs more than 700 calories and an incredible 29 grams of saturated fat, or nearly 50 percent more than the average person should take in each day. And thats one of the better choices: a serving of the carrot cake has twice as many calories (1,550) and just as much saturated fat.

Use this principle to your advantage. Minimize temptation. Many of us find it hard to ignore sweet chocolates, cookies, chips, ice cream, or other goodies when they are sitting on a shelf or in the refrigerator. Out of sight doesnt necessarily mean out of mind. Keeping calorie-laden snacks out of your home offers a much better deterrent. In their place, keep on hand a supply of low-calorie snacks such as apples, carrots, or whole-grain crackers for when you really want to munch on something. Be vigilant. The food industry is out to exploit your weaknesses and destroy your defenses. You need to be smart to avoid their traps. Keep it simple.

Think back to the last time you wandered through a cafeteria with great choices and youll probably picture a tray piled with more food than you usually eat. Theres no question that we need variety in our diets. Different foods offer different nutrients that are essential for good health. At each meal, though, simplicity may be a better strategy. Youll probably eat less if your entire meal is a chicken dish and vegetables than if you prepare several tempting recipes. Such simplification runs counter to trends in the marketplace, as the food industry offers an ever-growing and ever-beguiling variety of foods. But it may help reverse the ever-expanding trend of your waistline. Beware of liquid calories. Sugary sodas and fruit drinks can be a big source of invisible extra calories that you can easily cut from your diet. A small glass of juice in the morning is perfectly good for you. It offers a refreshing way to start the day and provides some vitamins and minerals. But drinking juice throughout the day can add hundreds of extra calories. Keep in mind that you would have to eat two or three oranges to get the same number of calories as you do from a glass of orange juice.

You dont have to know anything about medicine, nutrition, or even physiology. All you need is an idea and the chutzpah to promote and sell it. The graveyard of fad diets stands in silent testimony to their design flaws. Remember the cabbage soup diet, which claimed that the more cabbage soup you ate, the more weight you would lose? How about the rigid Scarsdale diet, which promised 1-pound-per-day weight loss by limiting daily intake to about 1,000 calories a day with the help of specified amounts of fruits, vegetables, and mostly lean sources of protein?

Lets take a look at a few popular ones. LOW-FAT DIETS The two key ideas behind low-fat diets are: fat makes you fat and fat is bad for the heart. Neither of these is accurate. One of the best-known low-fat diets is Dr. Dean Ornishs Eat More, Weigh Less plan. The eat more idea comes from the fact that fat contains 9 calories per gram while carbohydrates contain 4 calories. By switching from fatty foods to carbohydrate-rich ones, especially fruits and vegetables, you can double your food intake without taking in more calories.",

The Ornish plan got a boost from a small study that Dr. Ornish conducted among forty-eight men and women with heart disease.24 It showed that a very-lowfat vegetarian, whole-grain diet, along with exercise, stress management, and group support, reduced the narrowing of blood vessels in the heart better than less intensive changes. The improvement could have come from the low-fat diet. It could also have come from the other changes. Keep in mind that doing Ornish means forgoing refined grains in favor of whole grains. It also means exercising. Eating carbohydrates without exercising can increase triglycerides and decrease protective HDL cholesterol, neither of which is good for the heart. Reducing stress is another essential part of the program. There is no question that following a low-fat diet can aid weight loss, at least for the short term. Some people manage to stick with such a diet for the long haul. But that takes real commitment. Why? A low-fat diet tends to be less flavorful than other eating strategies and more restrictive about food choices, especially when dining out. It can also leave you feeling hungry, one reason why low-fat diets usually call for high-fiber foods that increase the sensation of fullness as well as between-meal snacks.

The reputation of low-fat diets as being good for the heart is a holdover from a time when many experts believed that all fats were bad for the heart. This belief has faded in light of findings that unsaturated fats can improve cholesterol levels, reduce blood pressure, and snuff out potentially deadly heart rhythm disturbances. Bottom line: Some people lose weight and keep it off with a low-fat diet. Others lose weight then put it back on, or dont lose weight at all. On average, most people do worse over the long run on low-fat diets than on higher-fat diets (see A LowCarb Diet May Help on page 53).25 It can be difficult to stick with a low-fat diet for a long time because fats make food taste good and a low-fat diet limits the number and types of food you can eat. If you decide to follow a low-fat diet, choose intact or whole grains, fruits, vegetables, beans, and other slowly digested carbohydrate-rich foods. LOW-CARB DIETS In the 1990s, carbohydrates began to replace fats as the great dietary demon. Thanks to Dr. Robert Atkins (Dr. Atkins Diet Revolution) and Dr. Arthur Agatston (The South Beach Diet), millions of Americans gave up bread, pasta, rice, and other carbohydrate unmentionables in their quest to lose weight.

Low-carb diets tend to be better than low-fat diets at helping people lose weight. The main issue with them is what to eat in place of carbohydrates. Many people choose hamburger, steak, and sausage. These deliver a lot of saturated fat, which can counterbalance the metabolic benefits of reducing carbohydrate intake. Highprotein and high-fat options based on plant foods, such as beans, soy, nuts, and liquid plant oils, are better choices, and fish and poultry are fine to include. Shying away from whole grains, fruits, and vegetables can lead to low intake of fiber, healthy fats, vitamins, and mineralsdeficits that supplements cant possibly overcome.

RIGHT-CARB DIETS Instead of banning carbohydrates, diets such as the Glucose Revolution, Wheat Belly, and Sugar Busters! embrace correct carbohydrates while shunning harmful ones. This means eating plenty of fruits, vegetables, and whole grains (no wheat in the case of the Wheat Belly diet) and cutting way back on refined sugars (white sugar, high-fructose corn syrup, honey, molasses, etc.) and processed grains. Right-carb diets rely heavily on the glycemic index and glycemic load (see pages 118122). These measure how strongly a particular food boosts blood sugar and insulin levels. Right-carb diets focus on foods that make blood sugar and insulin levels rise slowly. These foods include whole grains, beans, vegetables, and fruits. In theory, foods with a low glycemic index, which generate small but steady increases in blood sugar, help stave off hunger, while foods with a high glycemic index cause large but fleeting increases that quickly ring your internal hunger alarm. There isnt enough solid research to confirm the effectiveness of right-carb diets for weight control. A six-month trial showed that lowering the glycemic index offers modest benefits for weight loss.27 It would be quite useful for a research team to mount a large two-year trial examining the effect of a lower glycemic diet on weight control.",

Bottom line: In general, right-carb diets promote healthy eating by focusing on fruits, vegetables, and intact whole grains. Their reliance on the glycemic index can overly complicate choosing what to eat, especially when dining out. Diets that completely prohibit refined sugars also make dieting and healthy eating unnecessarily complex. Cutting back on foods made with refined carbohydrates and added sugars certainly makes sense. Traditional Mediterranean diets have a relatively low impact on blood sugar because they use plenty of fruits and vegetables, are relatively high in healthy fats, and are relatively low in easily digested carbohydrates. So do diets like these that are in line with Harvards Healthy Eating Pyramid and Healthy Eating Plate (see pages 16, 19). Their benefit on weigh control likely comes from multiple factors, including low glycemic effects. PERFECT PROPORTIONS COMBINATIONS AND CORRECT Several popular diets are based on the notion that specific proportions of nutrients or certain combinations of foods are essential to weight loss.

You reach the Zone by creating meals and snacks that contain 9 grams of carbohydrate for every 7 grams of protein and 1.5 grams of fat (40 percent carbohydrate, 30 percent fat, and 30 percent protein). This might result in a healthy diet, but it might not; it depends on the sources of carbohydrate, protein, and fat. Whats more, there is little evidence that such a rigid approach to eating is necessary or even helpful for weight loss. This approach makes it difficult to eat with family members not on the program, or to dine out. But if you like structure and rules, then the Zone might be right for you. The Eat Right 4 Your Type diet takes an odd and even less scientific tack: that your blood type determines what you should eat (not to mention how you should exercise, what supplements you need, and what type of personality you have). According to this plan, people with type O blood need a high-protein, low-carb diet thats light on wheat and beans, while those with type A blood need a high-protein, low-carb diet that contains plenty of fish and beans but steers clear of red meat, dairy foods, and wheat.

Any success is almost certainly because such diets force you to focus on what you are eating and to eat less each day, not because of any nutritional or physiological secret the diet developers have uncovered. Their long-term health effects have not been studied. WHAT ABOUT ENERGY DENSITY? Another approach to losing weight takes aim at energy density, the concentration of calories in each portion of food (see Energy Density Isnt a Reliable Guide on page 55). The Volumetrics Weight-Control Plan tries to manipulate satiety, the bodys signals that it has gotten enough food by recommending foods that fill the belly without adding too many calories. These tend to be water-rich foods such as fruits, vegetables, low-fat milk, cooked grains, beans, lean meats, poultry, and fish. Soups, stews, casseroles, pasta with vegetables, and fruit-based desserts get the thumbs-up, while high-fat foods like potato chips and dry, calorie-dense ones like pretzels, crackers, and fat-free cookies get the thumbs-down.

Although the Volumetrics idea is appealing, and many of the foods included would be part of a healthy diet, it is much too simplistic. For example, a can of Coca-Cola has a low energy density but it contributes plenty of calories that do little to fill you up or delay hunger. White bread made from highly processed wheat that has been stripped of many vitamins, minerals, and fiber has low energy density, while a highfiber crisp bread has high energy density. But the energy density concept doesnt take into account how rapidly a food is digested and absorbed, which can have a big impact on the return of hunger. EAT LIKE ITS 100,000 B.C.

If everyone tried to eat such a diet, most of the earths 7.5 billion inhabitants would go hungry: it takes so much land and energy to produce meat that it would be impossible to feed even a billion earthlings on a paleo diet. A gatherer plant-based approach that has you eating lower on the food chain plenty of fruits, vegetables, whole grains, nuts, seeds, and the likeis far better than the average American diet. I was recently on a panel with S. Boyd Eaton, the radiologist whose 1985 paper Paleolithic NutritionA Consideration of Its Nature and Current Implications in the New England Journal of Medicine kicked off the concept of the paleo diet.28 He said that the concept of a gatherer paleo diet one based on food from plants rather than meatwould be a perfectly fine adaptation. BEHAVIOR CHANGE Some weight-loss strategies focus as much on how, why, and when you eat as on what you eat. The attention isnt entirely misplaced. Some people use food for comfort. They overeat because they are sad, lonely, frustrated, nervous, bored, depressed, or due to any number of other triggers.

Bottom line: There is no question that habits, behaviors, and relationships with other people and with food influence the ability to lose weight or maintain a steady weight. Some people can benefit from recognizing these issues and getting counseling for these underlying problems. But not all overweight people have dysfunctional habits or relationships. The truth is, everyone, overweight or not, needs to watch what and how much they eat and to exercise. THE EVIDENCE ON DIETS Although the glut of unsubstantiated diet plans shows no signs of abating, we have learned quite a bit over the last fifteen years about strategies for weight control. Two things we know for sure about weight-loss diets:  Almost any type of diet works for a while.  No single diet works for everyone. As mentioned earlier, anyone can concoct and peddle a diet. No laws mandate that it be tested first. Some diet promoters try their plans on themselves, their families, and their friends. Those who lose weight become the success stories hyped in the books. But in most cases theres no hard-nosed evaluation of what percentage of people who start the diet stick with it or how many lose weight and keep it off.

Interestingly, this is similar to the experience of those who quit smoking: most do it on their own by going cold turkey, presumably motivated by the accumulation of information about the dangers of continuing to smoke.  98 percent changed what they ate in some way, usually by cutting back on daily calories.  94 percent exercised more, usually by walking. One of the main messages from the registry is that successful weight loss is very much a do it your way endeavor. Consumer Reports once surveyed more than 32,000 dieters. Its findings echoed the findings from the registry. Nearly one-quarter of those surveyed lost at least 10 percent of their starting body weight and kept it off for at least a year. Most chalked up their success to eating less and exercising more.30 The vast majority did it on their own, without resorting to commercial weight-loss programs or weight-loss drugs.

As I mentioned earlier, these are the gold standard of medical research. Such trials have shown that people who follow low-carb or Mediterranean diets tend to lose weight faster than those who follow low-fat diets. Interestingly, although some low-carb dieters who consume large amounts of meat and high-fat dairy foods have increases in harmful LDL cholesterol, low-carb dieters generally have larger reductions in potentially harmful triglycerides and increases in protective HDL cholesterol than low-fat dieters. The best long-term outcomes, both for weight and cholesterol and other metabolic variables, have been with the Mediterranean-type diet.

CHAPTER FIVE Straight Talk About Fat FEW PUBLIC HEALTH MESSAGES HAVE been as powerful and as persistent as the false Fat is bad message that has dominated talk about the American diet for decades. Beginning in the 1970s, fat became dietary Public Enemy Number One, feared for its ability to cause disease and even kill. As a nation, we took that message to heart. The average American now eats a lower percentage of calories from fat than he or she ate four decades ago. We spend billions of dollars a year on low-fat cookies, nofat salad dressing, pills that block the absorption of fat from the digestive system, and all manner of fat-busting diets and cookbooks. But we arent any healthier for it. In fact, were worse off in many ways. An astounding two-thirds of adult Americans are overweight.

Fast Fact: Putting Fats to Work Your body depends on fats for a host of functions. They are a major energy source for cells. They make up body fat (adipose tissue), which stores energy, cushions and protects vital organs, and provides insulation. Many people think of cholesterol as a fat, but it isnt, because it is made up of rings of carbon and hydrogen atoms, not simple chains (see Types of Fat on page 76). The body doesnt break down cholesterol for energy but instead uses it to make cell membranes, the critically important sheaths around nerves. It is also a building block from which the body makes vitamin D and many hormones. Before exploring the health effects of dietary fat on health, lets take a look at the varieties of this important component of food. What went wrong? The war on dietary fat ignored the simple fact that your body needs fat (see Fast Fact: Putting Fats to Work, page 75). Some types are essential for you, and its important to include them in your diet. These are the healthy unsaturated fats found in plant oils like olive, canola, soybean, and corn oils, and in fish. Cutting them from your diet is a bad idea. The true bad fats are trans and saturated fats.",

TYPES OF FAT Chemically speaking, the family of fatty acidsthe true and technical term for what most people just call fatsis part of the extended clan known as lipids. All members of the fatty acid family consist of a chain of carbon atoms bonded to hydrogen atoms with maybe a smattering of oxygen atoms. Thats itno nitrogen, iron, or other elements. What makes one fatty acid different from another is the number of carbon atoms, how the carbon atoms are connected to each other, and the geometry of the carbon chain.

Fats and Cholesterol in the Bloodstream For fats to get from your digestive system to the cells that need them, they must travel through your bloodstream. That isnt as simple as it sounds. Like oil and water, fats and blood dont mix. If your intestines or liver simply dumped digested fats into your blood, they would congeal into unusable globs. Instead, fat is packaged into protein-covered particles that mix easily with blood and flow with it. These tiny particles are called lipoproteins (lipid plus protein). During the packaging process, the body adds some cholesterol for delivery to cells and to help stabilize the particles. Like a highway at rush hour, your bloodstream carries many sizes and shapes of fattransporting particles. Lipoproteins are generally classified by the balance of fat and protein they contain. Those with a little fat and a lot of protein are heavier and more dense; those that contain more fat than protein are lighter, fluffier, and less dense. The proteins do more than help fat mix with blood. Those on the outside of the particles act like address labels that help the body route fat-filled particles to specific destinations.",

Cholesterol Testing When you have your cholesterol checked, you usually get back several test results. Total cholesterol tells you how much LDL, HDL, and other lipoprotein particles are circulating in your blood. The ideal total cholesterol level is under 200 milligrams per deciliter (onetenth of a liter) of blood. Borderline high cholesterol is a total cholesterol level between 200 and 239 milligrams per deciliter and high cholesterol is 240 milligrams per deciliter or higher. Because total cholesterol is a mix of bad and good, it doesnt tell the whole story about whats happening in your bloodstream, arteries, and other tissues. Thats why many physicians also check LDL and HDL levels. The lower the LDL the better, with anything under 130 milligrams per deciliter considered healthy. A level between 130 and 159 milligrams per deciliter is borderline high, and 160 milligrams per deciliter or above is high. For people with heart disease or at high risk for it, the thresholds are lower. The opposite is true for HDL: higher levels offer greater protection against heart disease.

Almost all of the fatty acids in our diet are triglycerides: three fatty acids bound together by a glue called glycerol. There are four main categories of these: saturated, monounsaturated, polyunsaturated, and trans (see Types of Dietary Fat on page 76). From here on out I will refer to fatty acids simply as fats, which is how they are listed on food labels. Until the middle of the twentieth century, fats were thought to play one main role in the body: serving as fuel for cells. We now know that they have many other important jobs. Fats provide the raw materials for building cell membranes, the delicate yet sturdy skin that surrounds cells and controls what gets in and what gets out. Fats make up the sheaths that surround and protect nerves. They provide raw materials that the body uses to make hormones and the chemicals that control blood clotting and muscle contraction.

It can also build fat from carbohydrates. However, a few fats cant be made from scratch. Called essential fats, these must come directly from food. Here is a quick overview of the types of fat in food, and how they affect the body. Saturated fat. The term saturated means that the carbon atoms in a chain hold the maximum number of hydrogen atoms they possibly can. This happens only when each carbon atom is connected to its carbon neighbors by single bonds. Saturated fats look like straight chains. About two dozen different saturated fats exist in nature. They are abundant in meat and animal fat, milk and dairy foods, and a few vegetable oils like palm and coconut oil. At room temperature, saturated fats are solid rather than liquid, something you see if you let the drippings from cooked bacon or hamburger congeal in a pan. When it comes to their effects on cholesterol and the artery-clogging process known as atherosclerosis, saturated fats come in gradations of bad. The saturated fats in butter and other dairy foods strongly increase harmful LDL cholesterol (see Cholesterol Types and the Heart on page 79). Those in beef fat arent quite as powerful at boosting LDL, and those in chocolate and cocoa butter have an even smaller impact. The saturated fats in coconut oil give an extra boost to protective HDL.",

That has given a halo to this source of fat, which is often touted as being a wonder food for the heart, the skin, and more. But any HDL boost from coconut oil doesnt compensate for its LDL-raising effect. Fast Fact: Cholesterol Types and the Heart Cholesterol moves through the bloodstream packaged in tiny particles called lipoproteins. The three key types, low-density lipoprotein (LDL), high-density lipoprotein (HDL), and very-low-density lipoprotein (VLDL), have the biggest effects on heart health. LDL is often referred to as bad cholesterol. When there are too many LDL particles in circulation, they can build up inside of artery walls. This narrowing of the artery, called atherosclerosis, makes it difficult for blood to flow through the vessel. These cholesterolladen buildups, called plaque, set the stage for heart attacks and strokes. In contrast, HDL is often referred to as good cholesterol. These particles sponge up cholesterol from the bloodstream, the lining of blood vessels, LDL and VLDL particles, and elsewhere. They carry it to the liver for disposal. HDL also helps the liver recycle other lipoprotein particles. Triglycerides make up most of the fat that you eat and most of the fat that circulates in your bloodstream.

But, as is the case for cholesterol, too many triglycerides in circulation may be bad for the arteries and the heart. Monounsaturated fat. The Greek prefix mono-, meaning one, hints at the structure of these fats. At one point along the carbon backbone, two carbons are connected by a double bond. This seemingly small change in structure leads to three key differences. It reduces the number of hydrogen atoms the carbon chain can hold by two. It changes the shape of the molecule from a straight chain to a bent stick. And it makes the fat a liquid at room temperature. Monounsaturated fats are the primary fat in plant oils, including olive oil, peanut oil, and canola oil. Avocados and most nuts are also good sources of this healthful fat. When eaten in place of carbohydrates or saturated fat, monounsaturated fats reduce harmful LDL. Polyunsaturated fat. A fat with two or more double bonds is a polyunsaturated fat. A polyunsaturated fat holds even fewer hydrogen atoms than a monounsaturated fat with the same number of carbon atoms. Magnified thousands of times, a polyunsaturated fat would look like a stick with two or more bends. Polyunsaturated fats are also liquid at room temperature. Polyunsaturated fats can be subdivided into the omega-3 and omega-6 groups.",

Each type plays different roles in the body. Our bodies dont make polyunsaturated fats, so we need to get these essential fats from eating plant oils like corn and soybean oil, seeds, whole grains, and fatty fish such as sardines, salmon, and tuna. Like monounsaturated fats, eating polyunsaturated fats in place of carbohydrates or saturated fat reduces harmful LDL. They are needed for cell growth, brain function, and proper functioning of the immune system, and also help the heart keep a steady rhythm. Trans fats. More than one hundred years ago, food chemists discovered that they could solidify polyunsaturated vegetable oil by heating it in the presence of hydrogen gas and finely ground particles of nickel. During the process, called partial hydrogenation, hydrogen latches on to somebut not allof the double-bonded carbons, changing them into single bonds. At the same time some of the remaining double bonds twist into a new straightened shape, which gives the fat new chemical and physical properties. Why did anyone bother? It turns out that its easier to ship and store solidified vegetable oil than liquid oil. Partially hydrogenated vegetable oil can be used in place of butter or lard in baking.",

OMEGA-3 FATS: A SPECIAL BENEFIT One type of polyunsaturated fat deserves extra attention, even though it makes up a small part of the fat in our diet. These are the omega-3 fatty acids (also called n-3 fats). They are essential fats, which means your body needs them for normal functions but cant make them from scratch. There are three key types of omega-3 fats in our diet. Since their names are a mouthful, Ill use their abbreviations: ALA (alpha-linolenic acid), EPA (eicosapentaenoic acid), and DHA (docosahexaenoic acid). As polyunsaturated fats, they have two or more extra-strong double bonds joining neighboring carbon atoms. The first double bond is on the third carbon from the end. ALA, with eighteen carbons, is sometimes called a medium-chain omega-3 fat; EPA and DHA are sometimes called long-chain omega-3 fats because EPA contains twenty carbons and DHA contains twenty-two. ALA is the main omega-3 fatty acid in most Western diets. Its found in a variety of vegetable oils (especially soybean and canola oils) as well as walnuts, leafy vegetables, and so",

EPA and DHA come mainly from fish and so are sometimes referred to as the marine omega-3s. Your body uses ALA primarily for energy. It can also transform this polyunsaturated fat into EPA and DHA, although it cant do the reverse. What makes omega-3 fatty acids so special? For one thing, they are necessary to make cell membranes throughout the body. Membranes hold the contents of cells together, and determine what comes in and what goes out. DHA, for example, is the most abundant fatty acid in the human brain.2 For another, they provide the starting point from which some hormones are made. These omega-3derived hormones perform functions such as regulating blood clotting, helping artery walls contract and relax, and turning inflammation on and off. Equally important, omega-3 fats have been shown to help prevent or treat heart disease and stroke. They may help control lupus, eczema, and rheumatoid arthritis. They may also help prevent dementia, loss of vision from macular degeneration, and other chronic conditions. The strongest evidence for a beneficial effect of omega-3 fats is in preventing death from heart disease.

Omega-6 Confusion Several popular books are based on the idea that eating too much omega-6 fats from good sources such as corn, sunflower, and soybean oils is bad for health. Omega-6 worriers claim that higher intakes of these increase inflammation throughout the body and increase the risk of asthma, heart disease, many types of cancer, autoimmune disease, neurodegenerative diseases, and more. But this is merely a theory, which has not been borne out by the many studies that have examined it. In fact, several dozen studies have looked at the effects of omega-6 fats on inflammation. Remarkably, none show an increase and about half show a reduction in chronic inflammation, which is a good thing. Alpha-Linolenic Acid in Various Foods Food Flaxseed oil Serving 1 tbsp.

But there is also strong evidence that omega-6s, which make up the majority of the polyunsaturated fats in our diet, help shape healthy cholesterol levels and reduce heart disease. In the Nurses Health Study, the ratio of omega-3 to omega-6 fatty acids wasnt linked with risk of heart disease because both of these were beneficial.3 In 2016, our group examined consumption of different types of fat in relation to deaths from all causes.

We do know, though, that reducing omega-6 fatty acids from the current amounts in the average American diet is likely to wipe out many of the gains we have made in preventing deaths from heart disease over the last fifty years. TRANS FATSA SPECIAL CONCERN Theres a family of fats you should definitely stay away from: the trans fats. These are mostly man-made fats that almost invisibly became a substantial part of the American diet. Thanks to long-awaited FDA rulings, that has changed in the past fifteen years. A century ago, the average American ate a minuscule amount of trans fats, which naturally occur in meat and milk. By the early 1990s, however, trans fats contributed an average of 2 to 3 percent of total calories, with many people taking in double or triple this amount. Thats because the food industry had found hundreds of uses for partially hydrogenated oils, the main source of artificial trans fats.

How bad are trans fats for us? Like saturated fats, trans fats raise levels of harmful LDL cholesterol. They are particularly good at boosting levels of small, dense LDL particles, the kind that are most damaging to arteries. They elevate levels of triglycerides and lipoproteins, both unhealthy trends that have been linked with heart disease. They lower the level of protective HDL cholesterol, something that saturated fats dont do. They promote the formation of blood clots inside blood vessels, which can trigger heart attacks and strokes. They cause inflammation, an overactivity of the immune system that plays key roles in the development of heart disease, diabetes, and other leading causes of death and disability. They also increase insulin resistance, a precursor of diabetes and its complications. The rise in the amount of trans fats made and eaten in the United States suspiciously paralleled the rise in heart disease throughout much of this century. In the Nurses Health Study, women who ate the most trans fats (about 7 grams of trans fats a day, or about 3 percent of daily energy) were more than 50 percent more likely to have developed heart disease over a fourteen-year period than those who ate the least (slightly over 1 percent of daily calories).5 The risk of",

For the longest time, trans fats existed as stealth fats because food makers didnt have to list them on food labels. The only way you could have known that trans fat was in a particular food was to scrutinize the ingredients list and recognize partially hydrogenated vegetable oil or vegetable shortening, the giveaways for trans fats. But even then you couldnt tell how much trans fat was present. After a long campaign led by Fred A. Kummerow, now professor emeritus of food science and human nutrition at the University of Illinois, along with the Center for Science in the Public Interest and members of our Department of Nutrition, the FDA in 2003 ruled that trans fats were even more harmful than saturated fats and had to be included on the Nutrition Facts label by 2006. This let consumers know which foods contained trans fats and also provided a strong incentive for manufacturers to remove them from their products. The FDA took an even bigger step in 2015 when it ruled that partially hydrogenated oils, which are the main source of harmful trans fats in food, are no longer generally recognized as safe.7 At the time, Susan Mayne, the director of the FDAs Center fo",

(We werent the first, though, as Denmark and other countries had banned trans fat years earlier.) In the 2015 ruling, food companies were given until 2018 to stop using transcontaining partially hydrogenated oils. Any companies wanting to continue to use them after 2018 must get the FDAs special approval to do so, which is unlikely to happen. We have estimated that eliminating trans fats from our food supply would prevent between 72,000 and 220,000 heart attacks or heart disease deaths per year.9 The Center for Science in the Public Interest projected that this would save 50 billion in medical costs a year.

In the United States alone, more than 1.5 million people have heart attacks or strokes each year, and these two conditions account for about one-third of all deaths. The cost of heart disease and stroke is close to 320 billion a year, including the costs of lost productivity.10 Dietary fats arent the only factors that affect the risk of heart disease. Smoking, being overweight or obese, and inactivity contribute a substantial share of deaths and disability. But managing the type of fat you eat is an important way to prevent heart disease. HOW DIETARY GUIDELINES HAVE DISTORTED THE FAT FACTS The traditional link between diet and heart disease goes like this: (1) Too much fat in the diet increases cholesterol levels in the blood. (2) Too much cholesterol in the bloodstream increases the chance of having a heart attack or stroke or developing some other form of cardiovascular disease.

Remember, the goal here isnt adding more fat to your diet. Its cutting back on bad fats (eliminating trans fat and limiting saturated fat) while increasing good fats (monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats) and keeping the number of daily calories constant. Do that and you wont gain weight. If you follow a low-fat diet and your level of protective HDL is low, your triglyceride level is high, or you are having trouble controlling your weight, think about cutting back on carbohydratesespecially highly processed onesand adding in foods that deliver unsaturated fat. Even though theres a nice, intuitive feel to the notion that eating more fat makes you fatter, for most people, theres little evidence to confirm it. For example, randomized trials comparing low-fat diets against higher-fat (low-carb) diets show that both can help people lose weight.11 On average, though, most people do better on lower carbohydrate, higher fat diets (see A Low-Carb Diet May Help, page 53).12 In the United States, the gradual reduction in the fat content of the average dietfrom over 40 percent of calories in the 1960s to about 33 percent todayhas been accompanied by a gradual increase in average weight and a dramatic increas",

If you keep your calories constant, though, you wont gain weight if you cut back on saturated fat, refined carbohydrates, and sugar and eat more unsaturated fat. The relatively simple diet-heart hypothesis leaves out a lot. An important omission is that different fats have different effects on cholesterol. Whats more, there are many ways that dietary fat can affect heart disease other than through the single channel of total cholesterol. Dietary fats influence how much harmful LDL and protective HDL are in your bloodstream, how your blood clots, how susceptible your heart is to erratic rhythms, and how the inner lining of your blood vessels responds to stressand probably affects other pathways to heart disease we havent yet discovered. Tragically, public policy based on the oversimplified diet-heart hypothesis doesnt cover these alternate pathways.

SIMPLER GUIDELINES ARENT ALWAYS BETTER Back in 1957, with only a limited amount of hard data at hand, the American Heart Association (AHA) set out its first dietary guidelines.13 Although the AHA hedged its bets with liberal use of the word may, its first guidelines were remarkably on target. They said: (1) Diet may play an important role in the development of heart disease. (2) Both the fat content and the total calories in the diet are probably important. (3) The ratio between saturated and unsaturated fats may be the basic determinant, and people should get more unsaturated fat and less saturated fat. (4) A wide variety of other factors besides fat, both dietary and nondietary, may be important. Four years later the AHA was still suggesting that people increase their intake of unsaturated fat.

Today, fats and oils make up about 33 percent of the calories in the average diet, compared with 40 percent in the 1960s. If this reduction meant we were eating less potentially harmful saturated fat, that would be great news and would show up as lower rates of heart disease. But weve thrown out the baby with the bathwater, mainly cutting back on beneficial unsaturated fats.

If you follow the standard dietary guidelines, that something else has traditionally been carbohydrates, usually foods rich in simple or highly processed carbohydrates, such as sugar, white bread, white rice, and potatoes. Replacing foods rich in saturated fat with those rich in refined carbohydrates lowers total cholesterol levels a bit. But it also lowers levels of protective HDL cholesterol.

Carbohydrates can and do increase weight every bit as effectively as fats if you consume more calories than you burn off. Equally harmful, white bread and other foods made from white flour, potatoes, pasta, and white rice cause large spikes in blood sugar (glucose) and insulin, something that doesnt happen with fat, protein, and slowly absorbed carbohydrates like those from intact whole grains, beans, fruits, and non-starchy vegetables (see chapter six). Spikes in blood sugar and insulin place a constant and heavy demand on the pancreas to make more insulin. This is a key ingredient for adult-onset diabetes, now called type 2 diabetes, especially when paired with lack of exercise. Eating carbohydrates instead of unsaturated fats also tends to increase blood pressure.14 Finally, following a low-fat diet usually means forgoing foods such as nuts, avocados, salad dressings made with unsaturated oils, and other foods that contain beneficial monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats.

No research has ever shown that people who regularly eat eggs have more heart attacks than people who dont eat eggs. In the late 1990s my colleagues and I looked at the eggeating habits of almost 120,000 healthy men and women.

TRACING THE HEALTH EFFECTS OF DIETARY FATS Until the middle of the last century, when infectious diseases like tuberculosis and influenza were leading causes of death, calorie-rich diets laden with fat were thought to provide some protection against disease and aid in recovery. As late as the 1950s, a healthy diet meant eggs, bacon, and butter-slathered toast for breakfast and roast beef and mashed potatoes with gravy for dinner. Our comfortable, almost thoughtless relationship with food was forever changed by separate threads of research that came together after World War II. Large studies in the late 1940s and early 1950s began to focus on diet as a cause of the skyrocketing rates of heart disease. In 1956, a University of Minnesota scientist named Ancel Keys began an international survey called the Seven Countries Study. It suggested a connection between saturated fat and heart disease: in general, the higher the amount of saturated fat in a countrys diet, the higher the rate of heart disease. Interestingly, Keys and his colleagues didnt find any connection between the total amount of fat in the diet and heart disease. In fact, the area with the lowest rate of heart disease in the study, Crete, had the highest average total fat intake: about 40 percent of caloriesm",

One of its early findings was that high levels of cholesterol in the bloodstream were often an early signal of impending heart disease. These important studies and others pointed to diet as a key element in the path to heart disease. Without turning this into a textbook of nutritional epidemiology, Ill briefly describe the consistent evidence from several kinds of studies showing the harmful effects of saturated and trans fats and the benefits that can come from replacing these harmful fats with unsaturated fats. Cross-Cultural Surveys: More Saturated Fat  More Heart Disease The country-by-country surveys of Ancel Keys and others showed that heart disease rates varied more than tenfold between Crete and Finland, the Seven Countries Study country with the highest rates. The more saturated fat in a countrys average diet, the higher the rates of heart disease. Although the Seven Countries and Framingham studies pointed to saturated fat as a major driver of heart disease, other factors, such as differences in cigarette smoking and amount of physical activity, could have contributed to the large difference in rates.",

Metabolic Studies: Good Fats Improve the Cholesterol Profile In the 1950s and 1960s, dozens of carefully controlled feeding studies among small groups of volunteers showed conclusively that eating saturated fats instead of carbohydrates led to a rise in total cholesterol, and eating polyunsaturated fats instead of carbohydrates led to a reduction in total cholesterol. Thus, for decades we have known that all fats shouldnt be considered equal. Unfortunately, at that time the importance of other blood lipidsprotective HDL in particularwasnt appreciated. So those studies gave an incomplete picture at best. One of the early and most compelling pieces of evidence to challenge the emphasis on cutting back on all fat and eating more carbohydrates came from an experiment by two Dutch scientists.18 They recruited forty-eight volunteers for an eight-week study. For the first seventeen days, all of the volunteers ate a typical Western diet with about 40 percent of calories from fat. For the next thirty-six days, half of the volunteers were assigned to a diet in which part of the saturated fat was replaced by olive oil, while the other half followed a diet in which some of the saturated fat was replaced by carbohydrates. In both groups, total cholesterol levels plummeted (see Figure 13).19 But in the high-carbohydrate group, levels of protective HDL",

In the olive oil group, a healthy trend was seen for total cholesterol without the unhealthy changes in HDL and triglycerides. The benefits of cutting back on carbohydrates and adding in more unsaturated fats seen in that study have been confirmed by many research groups. One of these confirmatory studies, from the University of Washington, documented that these changes werent fleeting.20 In this study, 444 men with high cholesterol were asked to follow one of four diets, containing either 30 percent, 28 percent, 22 percent, or 18 percent of fat. After a year, all four diets had lowered harmful LDL cholesterol. But the two lowest-fat diets also dropped the level of protective HDL cholesterol and raised the level of triglycerides. Figure 13. Blood Fat Responses to Olive Oil vs. Carbohydrates. A diet rich in unsaturated fat (olive oil) improved HDL cholesterol and triglyceride levels compared with a diet rich in carbohydrates.

The Dutch study, and the many others that have repeated this test, leave no doubt that eating carbohydrates instead of saturated fats the typical low-fat diethas little effect on the ratio of LDL to HDL, and that eating unsaturated fats instead of saturated fats improves it. Cohort Studies: More Good Fats  Less Heart Disease The connection between dietary fat and heart disease has long been murky, stirred up by many small and short-term studies. To make sense of this important relationship, my colleagues and I completed in 2016 what was the most detailed and comprehensive analysis of dietary fat and health to date.21 We used information provided by 126,233 initially healthy women and men participating in the Nurses Health Study and the Health Professionals Follow-Up Study, who were followed for up to thirty-two years. Every two years from the start of the study, we asked the participants about smoking, weight, physical activity, medical diagnoses, medications, and other things that could affect their disease risk. Every four years we asked them to complete detailed questionnaires about their diets.",

From the diet data we were able to calculate their intakes of various types of fat by using routinely updated databases on the fat composition of thousands of foods. During the study period, 33,304 of the participants died. We confirmed each cause of death by examining medical records and death certificates. Somewhat to our surprise, participants with the highest intake of total fat (about 42 percent of calories) were 16 percent less likely to have died during the course of the study as those with the lowest total fat intake (25 percent of calories). My colleagues and I suspect that the lower risk among those with higher-fat diets was due in part to the greatly improved quality of fat in the American diet following the near elimination of partially hydrogenated oils rich in trans fats (see Trans Fats, page 83) and their replacement by unsaturated oils. Even more important than the finding for total fat were the strong relationships between specific types of fat and death. When compared to the same number of calories from carbohydrates, trans fats were most strongly associated with increased risk of dying during the study, saturated fats with a slightly higher risk, monounsaturated fats with a moderately lower risk, and polyunsaturated fats with a substantially lower risk.",

The biological basis for some of these findings, especially neurodegenerative disease, is not well understood and is the topic of ongoing investigation. I must offer a word of caution when interpreting these results. When I say compared to the same number of calories from carbohydrates, I mean the kinds of carbohydrates actually being consumed by the study participants, which included a large amount of sugar and refined starch. Total fat wouldnt have looked as good, and saturated fat would have looked even worse, if we had compared them to the same number of calories from whole grains. Ill explore these distinctions further in chapter six. This analysis provides a big picture of the relationship between the amount and type of dietary fat in our diets and health.

Clinical Trials: Replacing Saturated Fats with Unsaturated Fats Saves Lives Clinical trials bear out the overall picture of dietary fats I have been drawing in this book: some fats are good for health and others arent. Early trialsmost of which were done decades ago, were very small, and enrolled people who already had heart diseaseshowed that eating less total fat, usually by eating more carbohydrate-rich foods like white rice and potatoes, did little for the heart and blood vessels. In stark contrast to that work, clinical trials in which volunteers were randomly assigned to either a standard Western diet, which is relatively rich in saturated fats, or a diet in which some saturated fats were replaced with polyunsaturated fats have shown benefits such as lower levels of total cholesterol and harmful LDL cholesterol and, more important, reductions in heart disease of one-third or more.

Half of the 605 volunteers were asked to follow a low-fat diet.

PLENTY OF PROOF FOR THE BENEFITS OF UNSATURATED FATS The popular view of science is that if you assemble the facts, they will give you clear, definite answers. The reality of science usually isnt anything like that, especially when it comes to human nutrition and its connection with disease. We have an ocean of existing facts and a steady deluge of new data, but only a few solid answers. Thats because studies are always open to criticism and their results to interpretation. It is standard operating procedure to conclude that more research is needed, a phrase I have often used in reporting the results of a study or writing an editorial or review on specific aspects of diet and disease. I dont feel that way at all about what people should be doing with dietary fat. Cutting back on all types of fat and eating more carbs does nothing to protect against heart disease and will ultimately harm some people.

Mark Bittman, writing in the New York Times, wrote: Butter is back. Julia Child, goddess of fat, is beaming somewhere. Other headlines were equally effusive. Consumers sighed, blindsided again by confusing and contradictory results from nutrition research. The Great Butter Battle Beginning in the 1970s, many people accepted the demise of butter and gave it up, ruing the loss of its savory flavor but agreeing that the amount of saturated fat it contained might be bad for the heart. They dutifully switched to margarine, as researchers and nutritionists suggested. When later reports highlighted the hazards of margarine, though, many people felt duped. There never was any good evidence that switching from butter to margarine cut the chances of having a heart attack or developing heart disease.

But recommendations to switch from butter to margarine overlooked the large amounts of trans fats in many margarines. Today, the butter-versus-margarine argument doesnt make sense. From the standpoint of heart disease, butter is on the list of foods to use sparingly, mostly because it contains so much of the kind of saturated fat that raises levels of harmful LDL. Many margarines now for sale are low in saturated fat, high in unsaturated fat, and free of trans fats. As long as you dont use too much, you should be fine. (They are still rich in calories.) But before you reach for butter or margarine, think about whether you could use olive oil or another liquid vegetable oil instead. If you cant do without the taste of butter when saut\u00e9ing vegetables, scallops, or eggs, melt a small pat of butter and add olive oil. The media attention was unfortunate, because the analysis was flawed in many ways.

Today they are fed grains that are low in them. The best source of omega-3s is fish, especially fatty fish such as salmon, tuna (including canned tuna), mackerel, herring, and sardines. Unfortunately, the relatively high price of fish often puts it beyond the budget of many households. Canned salmon gives the best buy for omega-3 fats and can be used in countless ways. Eating fish two to three times a week is a good target for almost everyone. Eating more than that adds little extra protection against heart disease. Young children, and women in their childbearing years, should focus on types low in mercury (see Fish, Mercury, and Fish Oil on page 147). As research in this area continues to unfold, including in your diet a good source of alpha-linolenic acid (ALA) on most days of the week ensures an adequate intake of omega-3 fats. Good ways to do this include eating walnuts, flaxseeds, or foods made with or cooked in canola or soybean oil.

Two years later, the National Cancer Institute made this the focus of a major health promotion campaign. These efforts have done little to prevent breast cancer. Since then, larger cohort studies of cancer have not supported a connection between dietary fat and breast cancer. In the Nurses Health Study, more than 8,000 of the participants have developed breast cancer since 1980.

It did not. If anything, higher fat intake before diagnosis was related to a slightly lower risk of dying from breast cancer.30 (In fact, in the PREDIMED trial described on page 96, women who followed a higher-fat Mediterranean-type diet were less likely to have developed breast cancer over the five-year trial than those following a low-fat diet.31 Although the number of cases was small, the findings were promising.) Most studies into the connection between dietary fat and breast cancer have focused on women in midlife or later. That makes sense, because breast cancer is more common in older women. But it can also strike younger women, and breast tissue is particularly vulnerable to carcinogenic influences at younger ages.

Because of the strong belief that dietary fat was linked to the development of breast cancer, the Womens Health Initiative was launched in 1991 with dietary fat as a prime focus. It was the most comprehensive and expensive clinical trial ever conducted. More than 48,000 women were randomized to follow either a low-fat diet or their usual diet. After seven years there was no significant difference in rates of breast cancer or, for that matter, heart disease or any other disease.34 Normally, a finding like that would put an end to the belief that a low-fat diet prevented breast cancer. But questions flew about whether the study had lasted long enough. In a follow-up publication, the authors reported that there were no differences at any time during the trial in blood levels of triglycerides or protective HDL between the two groups of women. We know that on a low-fat diet, triglycerides go up and HDL goes down. The lack of any change in these two indicated there was little if any difference in fat intakes between the study groups.",

In another randomized trial conducted in Canada, women at higher risk of breast cancer because of changes in their mammograms were randomly assigned to a low-fat diet or their usual diet for an average of ten years. Levels of protective HDL were lower among women on the low-fat diet, indicating that there was a difference in fat intake between the two groups. Those on the low-fat diet had a 19 percent higher risk of breast cancer. Although this increase was not statistically significant, it was certainly headed in the wrong direction.35 The relationship between fat intake and breast cancer risk has been studied intensively over the last three decades. Although its impossible to prove that dietary fat has absolutely no effect on breast cancerthere could always be a tiny effect too small to detectwe can be confident that low-fat diets dont play an important role in reducing the risk of breast cancer. There are, however, some hints that replacing fats from animal with those from plants may provide some benefit. The clearest and most consistent finding from both animal and human studies is that too many calories during adulthood, regardless of the foods they come from, are far more important to the development of breast cancer than dietary fat.

But that, too, hasnt been bolstered by more detailed work. There is good evidence that eating a lot of red meat increases the risk of colon cancer. This could stem from the types of fats in red meat or the cancer-causing chemicals generated by cooking red meat at high temperatures. The World Health Organization has warned that regularly eating red meat, especially processed meat, is linked to the development of colorectal cancer.36 Intake of fats from fish, chicken, and plants has not been associated with risk of colon or rectal cancer. As is the case for breast cancer, the strongest dietary link with colon cancer is the imbalance between calories consumed and calories burned: people who are overweight are more likely to develop this cancer than people who arent. Protection from colon cancer comes from getting regular physical activity, not smoking, and getting adequate amounts of folic acid, one of the B vitamins (see chapter eleven). Prostate Cancer The situation with prostate cancer is murkier, partly because there have been relatively few studies in this area.

Although Asian men do experience some increases in prostate cancer when they move to the United States, rates in this group always stay lower than among Caucasians, suggesting that some genetic factors play an important role. If there is a connection between dietary fat and prostate cancer, it seems to be mainly related to animal fat or some other component of red meat. Thats good news, because it means that olive oil and other unsaturated fats that decrease the risk of heart disease would not increase the risk of prostate cancer. Research on prostate cancer raises questions about a different kind of balance. Results from the Health Professionals Follow-Up Study and others have shown that men whose diets are rich in omega-3s from seafoodEPA and DHAare less likely to develop prostate cancer. The connection between omega-3s from plants alpha-linolenic acid (ALA)and prostate cancer has been a bit worrisome. Some studies suggest an increase in prostate cancer and advanced prostate cancer among men with high intakes of ALA,37 although we have not seen this in our most recent follow-up in the Health Professionals Follow-Up Study. Why might a seemingly healthful oil be implicated in prostate cancer? One possibility is that, until recently, much of the ALA in the American diet was actually a harmful trans fat (see Trans FatsA Special Concern on page 83).",

For years, oils rich in ALA routinely underwent partial hydrogenation to keep them from spoiling too quickly. But that also added trans fats to them. Partial hydrogenation has been greatly curtailed, which means we will be getting natural, untransformed ALA going forward. Walnuts offer a clue that this may explain the trend. Walnuts are an important source of ALA. Theyve never been partially hydrogenated, and consumption of walnuts has never been associated with higher risk of prostate cancer. While scientists will continue to monitor the relationship of ALA with prostate disease, I think men can enjoy walnuts, canola oil, and other foods rich in ALA without worrying about their prostates. The Bottom Line on Dietary Fats and Cancer It is impossible to prove that theres no connection between dietary fat and cancer. If fat does influence the development of cancer, though, evidence from large cohort studies with many years of follow-up shows that the effect is small. Given the strong and consistent association that has been observed between type of fat and heart disease, I think it makes sense to focus on dietary fats for their proven impact on heart disease, not for their hypothetical connections with cancers that so far have not been supported by extensive evidence.

If you believe, as I do, that a low-fat diet isnt the best way to a healthier heart, theres another option. This one requires a bit of cutting back, just as traditional low-fat diets do, but it also means consciously adding some fats to your diet. This takes some practice at first, but the effort will be well worth it, both in taste and health. Cutting back. Stay away from trans fats and limit your intake of saturated fats. Its gotten easier and easier to avoid trans fats, and it will soon be hard to find them even if you wanted to. When an FDA rule went into effect in 2006 that the amount of trans fat in a food had to be listed on the food label, many companies took that as an opportunity to find trans-free replacements (see Trans FatsA Special Concern on page 83). Limiting your intake of saturated fats means going easy on red meat and whole-fat dairy products, or not eating them at all. It isnt worth making yourself crazy to eliminate all traces of saturated fat from your diet.

Seven pats of butter, one Pizza Hut pan pizza (personal size), or three glasses of regular milk supply this much. It isnt necessary to count fat grams or whip out a calculator to compute the percentage of calories from fat. You have better things to do with your time, the payoff is very small, and theres no solid evidence for adopting exact numerical goals for total fat intake.

The calories are similar but these oils are rich in healthful unsaturated fats and low in saturated fat. Olive oil has only 1.8 grams of saturated fat per tablespoon; butter has 7, which is close to one-half of the daily limit. In fact, each tablespoon of butter gets more than half of its calories from saturated fat. INSTEAD OF BAKING CAKES, COOKIES, AND QUICK BREADS WITH SOLID SHORTENING . . .  Switch to healthful oils whenever possible. The calories are roughly the same but, again, the oils are rich in unsaturated fats. Solid shortenings are now available without unhealthful trans fats, and coconut oil, butter, or lard are options for occasional use when a hard fat is absolutely essential. INSTEAD OF COOKING PORK LOIN OR FATTIER CUTS OF PORK . . .  Switch to pork tenderloin. Pork tenderloin is as lean as skinless white meat chicken. A 3-ounce cooked serving contains only 4 grams of fat, just 1.4 grams of it saturated. The same-size serving of cooked pork loin contains nearly 12 grams of fat, 4.5 grams of it saturated.",

A 3-ounce portion of a fatty hamburger meat, before its cooked, can have nearly 23 grams of fat, 9 of it saturated. Lean ground beef, labeled at least 91 percent lean, carries only 8 grams of fat, 3 of it saturated. Cooking, particularly if you broil or grill meat to the well-done stage, can reduce fatbut not dramatically enough to make fatty meat as lean as the extra-lean variety. However, keep in mind that leaner red meat does not necessarily mean lower risk of heart disease or cancer; replacing red meat with alternative protein sources is the best option. INSTEAD OF USING WHOLE MILK IN SAUCES OR BAKED GOODS . . .  Switch to skim milk. Eight ounces of whole milk contain close to 8 grams of fat, nearly 5 of it saturated. Eight ounces of skim milk contain about 0.6 grams of fat, of which 0.4 grams are from saturated fat. Better yet, consider using soy milk or almond milk in its place.

This robbed the body of a host of substances that play roles in preventing heart disease, cancer, dementia, and other chronic diseases. Olestras maker, Procter  Gamble, rolled out chips and other products made with olestra. Fortunately, they were duds in the marketplace. Many other fat substitutes have been developed. Some, like Simplesse, are made from milk and egg protein. Some, like Avicel, are made from carbohydrates. Others, like Nutrim, are made from fiber. This high-fiber product is rich in beta-glucans, a group of soluble fibers that contribute to the cholesterol-lowering properties of oats and barley. Fat substitutes like olestra offered health hazards rather than improvements. Those such as Nutrim could be beneficial if they are used in place of saturated or trans fats. An equally healthy solution is to use liquid vegetable oils in place of saturated or trans fats. The bottom line is that we dont need gimmicks or fake foods in order to have healthy diets.

Traditionally the Chinese weighed less and were more physically active than Americans. Weight and exercise matter: high-carbohydrate diets have different effects on metabolism among lean, active people than they do on overweight, sedentary people. So simply eating a high-carbohydrate diet doesnt offer blanket protection against heart disease, cancer, and diabetes. Thats something the Chinese are now experiencing. Before 1980, under 1 percent of people in China had diabetes. Today more than 10 percent have it, due mainly to changes in lifestyle that have come with Chinas rapid economic growth.2 The problem is worse in Beijing and other urban areas as cars replace bicycles, desk jobs replace manual labor, and carbohydrate intake remains high. The other problem is that little attention has been paid to the types of carbohydrates we eat. In traditional cultures, grains tend to be eaten whole or lightly refined.

Simple carbohydrates like sugar were portrayed as the bad boys of nutrition, while complex carbohydrates like bread or rice were regarded as the golden children. That was a gross oversimplification. Not all simple carbohydrates are bad, and not all complex carbohydrates are good. Later in this chapter, I will describe two far more useful ways of categorizing carbohydrates: by their effect on blood sugar (the glycemic index) and by whether they come from refined or whole grains. Simple carbohydrates are sugars. The simplest simple carbohydrates are glucose (sometimes called dextrose), fructose (also called fruit sugar), and galactose (a part of milk sugar). Table sugar is sucrose, a combination of one molecule of glucose and one of fructose. Milk contains lactose, which is made by joining one molecule of glucose with one of galactose. Simple carbohydrates provide us with energy and little else. Complex carbohydrates are more . . . well, complex. In essence they are long chains of linked sugars. There are many types of complex carbohydrates in our food. The main one is starch, a long chain of glucose molecules. The human digestive system can rapidly break down starch and other complex carbohydrates into their component sugars.",

Some complex carbohydrates, like fiber, are quite indigestible and pass largely unchanged through the stomach and the intestines. Although fiber doesnt contribute any energy or molecular building blocks to the body, it is still an important part of our diet. Because the term complex carbohydrate includes both starch and fiber, it is a useless and potentially misleading term. WHY CARBOHYDRATES MATTER In the average American diet, carbohydrates contribute about half of all calories. In one study from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), a staggering half of these carbohydrate calories came from just eight sources:3  soft drinks, sodas, and fruit-flavored drinks  cake, sweet rolls, doughnuts, and pastries  pizza  potato chips, corn chips, and popcorn  rice  bread, rolls, buns, English muffins, and bagels  beer  french fries and frozen potatoes. Using data from NHANES, my colleagues and I calculated that about 80 percent of the carbohydrates in the U.S. diet come from sugar, refined starch, or potatoes. That means about 40 percent of all the calories we consume come from sugars, highly refined and easily digested grains, or potato starch, all of which are rapidly converted to blood sugar.

Eating other vegetables instead of potatoes and corn can help control your weight and your health. While corn is technically a whole grain, it has been so intensively bred for high starch content that it is no longer the same nutritious food that Tisquantum (Squanto) gave to the Pilgrims as they tried to eke out a living in North America. When you eat a slice of bread, a potato, or some candy, your body breaks down the digestible carbohydrates it contains. Starch is converted to glucose, which is rapidly absorbed into the bloodstream and swiftly shuttled to the farthest reaches of the circulatory system. Because these simple sugar molecules are a primary fuel for most of the bodys tissues, complex mechanisms are in place to make sure that the level of glucose in the bloodstream doesnt shoot too high or drift too low. Figure 15. Response to Eating Carbohydrates. Easily digested carbohydrates make blood sugar and insulin rise faster and higherand fall furtherthan slowly digested carbohydrates. The rise in blood glucose is followed quickly by a parallel rise in insulin (see Figure 15). This hormone, produced by special cells in the pancreas, ushers glucose into muscle and other cells.",

Corn Syrup Isnt to Blame One of the many dramatic changes in the American diet over the past fifty years has been in how we satisfy our craving for sugar. Until the 1970s, we relied almost exclusively on sucrose (table sugar) from sugarcane and sugar beets, with a bit of honey, maple sugar, and molasses thrown in for variety. Today more than half of our sugar comes from corn, much of it in the form of high-fructose corn syrup. Its found in everything from sugared sodas to ketchup and baby food. Why the change? High-fructose corn syrup tastes a bit sweeter than sucrose. Its easier to blend into beverages. And it costs a few pennies less per pound than sucrose. High-fructose corn syrup has been cast as one of the villains behind the obesity epidemic for a reason: the jump in its use closely parallels the trajectory of obesity rates. The body metabolizes fructose differently from glucose. Table sugar contains glucose and fructose in equal proportions (50 percent for both), since sucrose is made of one glucose molecule joined to one fructose molecule. High-fructose corn syrup is pure glucose mixed with pure fructose in almost equal proportions (55 percent fructose and 45 percent glucose).",

So table sugar and corn sweeteners have much the same physiological impact on blood sugar, insulin, and metabolism. Some people claim that theyve lost weight by cutting high-fructose corn syrup from their diets. That may be so, but it probably isnt because they eliminated corn sweeteners. What likely happened is that by eliminating corn sweeteners they took in fewer added sugars and thus fewer calories. So far, high-fructose corn sweetener doesnt seem to be a greater dietary disaster than any other kind of added sugar. So swapping a soda made with high-fructose corn sweetener for one made with natural sugar wont improve your health. Whats important is limiting your intake of all added sugars. The World Health Organization recommends keeping added sugars under 10 percent of daily calories (roughly 12 teaspoons or 50 grams), and getting under 5 percent of calories from them would provide additional health benefits.4 To help us keep track of added sugars, the FDA is now requiring food companies to list added sugar on their Nutrition Facts labels.

If there isnt any more digestible carbohydrate in the stomach or intestines, your gut and brain start sending out hunger signals to make you grab for more food even as the liver starts releasing stored glucose. In contrast, slowly digested whole-grain carbohydrates smooth out this glucose-insulin roller coaster. Because it takes longer for the digestive system to break down whole grains into sugar molecules, blood sugar and insulin levels rise more slowly and peak at lower levels. A more drawn-out process also means it takes longer to get hungry again. THE PROBLEM OF INSULIN RESISTANCE In a growing number of people, the bodys tissues dont respond to insulin as they should. Instead, they resist its Open up for sugar signal. This resistance to insulin keeps the amount of sugar in the bloodstream at high levels for longer periods and forces the pancreas to produce extra insulin in order to jam glucose into cells. Like an overworked, undermaintained pump, insulin-making cells in the pancreas may wear out and eventually stop producing enough insulin to keep blood sugar under control. Insulin resistance and faltering insulin production are early signs of type 2 diabetes, which was once called non-insulin-dependent diabetes and adult-onset diabetes.

The further you get above a healthy weight (see page 40), the more your body has trouble handling glucose. Inactivity comes next. The less active you are, the lower the ratio of muscle to fat you have, even if your weight is perfectly fine. Fat cells dont handle glucose as efficiently as muscle cells, especially regularly exercised muscle cells. The less muscle you have, the harder it is to clear glucose from the bloodstream. Working your muscles with daily physical activity improves their ability to remove glucose from the blood, even when you are resting or sleeping. Dietary fats play a modest role in insulin resistance, with low intake of polyunsaturated fat and high intake of trans fats leading to greater resistance. Genes also play a part. Insulin resistance is more common among Native Americans, Pacific Islanders, and people of Asian heritage than it is among those of European descent. But, like everyone else, people with a genetic predisposition to insulin resistance can beat the condition by staying lean, being physically active, and eating the right diet. Insulin resistance isnt just a blood sugar issue.

Whats more, experiments in which volunteers were asked to follow high-carbohydrate, low-fat diets ended up with heartunhealthy changes in levels of HDL and triglycerides, not to mention higher levels of blood sugar and insulin.5 These adverse changes are the most pronounced in overweight people. Put more plainly, a low-fat, high-carbohydrate diet may be a terrible eating strategy for individuals who are overweight and not physically active. They fare better with a diet that includes fewer refined carbohydrates, more whole and intact grains, more healthy protein, and more good fats. Whether or not you are overweight, the switch from refined to whole grains will be good for you because of the increased intake of micronutrients.

Not long ago, the rule of thumb was that sugars triggered rapid rises in blood sugar and insulin, while complex carbohydrates caused more delayed responses. But nutrition researcher David Jenkins and his colleagues at the University of Toronto overturned this conventional wisdom by systematically testing the impact of different foods on blood sugar levels (see Measuring the Glycemic Index and Glycemic Load on page 121). The carbohydrate ranking they developed, called the glycemic index (GI), counters the notion that all complex carbohydrates are good and all simple ones are bad.6 The higher a foods glycemic index, the faster and stronger it affects blood sugar and insulin levels. As a reference point, pure glucose the rapidly digested essence of blood sugaris assigned a score of 100. On this scale, anything below 55 or so is considered a low-glycemic-index food. Some of the glycemic index rankings are exactly what you might expect. An apple has a glycemic index of 38. A serving of old-fashioned (not instant) oatmeal has a glycemic index of 58. Jelly beans have a glycemic index of 78. Other rankings come as a surprise.

Low Glycemic Foods and Prevention of Diabetes: the Building Blocks of Evidence Over time, high blood sugar levels and a high demand for insulin will damage insulinsecreting cells in the pancreas and lead to type 2 diabetes. Thats good reason to suspect that diets with a high glycemic index will increase the risk of this disease. And theres evidence for it: in large cohort studies, my research team and others have found that people consuming diets with a high glycemic index have a greater risk of developing type 2 diabetes. This was borne out in an updated analysis of data from the Nurses Health Study and Health Professionals Follow-Up Study.7 Among more than 175,000 women and men followed for up to twenty-four years, 15,027 developed type 2 diabetes. In all three cohorts, participants who consumed diets with the highest glycemic index were 33 percent more likely to have developed diabetes than those consuming diets with the lowest glycemic index.8 A large study using a drug, not diet, adds to what I think is conclusive evidence that theres a cause-and-effect relationship between the glycemic index and the development of diabetes.",

The drug, called acarbose (brand name Precose), has long been used to treat diabetes. It specifically inhibits the bodys ability to chop up starch molecules into glucose molecules. In effect, it converts a high glycemic food into a low glycemic food without affecting its content of fiber or micronutrients. In a large randomized trial that compared acarbose with placebo, those taking the drug had a 25 percent lower risk of diabetes, as well as a similar reduction in risk for cardiovascular disease and high blood pressure.9 Foods with a high glycemic index offer a fast energy boost by quickly increasing blood sugar levels. (Thats one reason some people who use insulin to treat diabetes are urged to carry glucose tablets when they travel or exercise.) But such foods also promote equally swift drops in blood sugar that may trigger the early return of hunger. In contrast, the steadier, more sustained release of glucose from lowglycemic-index foods can stave off hunger for longer periods. There is also now strong evidence that eating foods lower on the glycemic index will help keep diabetes at bay (see Whole Grains Protect Against Diabetes on page 124).

As with the glycemic index, lower numbers are better. Good choices include foods with a glycemic load of 10 or less per serving, such as beans, fiber-rich fruits and vegetables, and edamame (soybeans still in the pod) and foods made from soybeans. Moderate choices such as oatmeal, sweet potatoes, and some whole-grain crackers have glycemic loads of 11 to 19. Foods with high glycemic loads (20 and above) include sugar-sweetened soda and fruit juice, white rice, french fries and baked potatoes, and pizza. Glycemic load better reflects a foods effect on your bodys biochemistry than either the amount of carbohydrate or the glycemic index alone. This is important: Some popular diet books warn against eating carrots because they were initially found to have a high glycemic index. Even if they do, carrots are mostly water, with only a small amount of carbohydrate. Finally, its important to consider the other nutrients in a food.

Measuring the Glycemic Index and Glycemic Load Building the library of glycemic index values for foods has been a relatively slow, painstaking effort. Thats because each food must be tested on a number of volunteers, and each volunteer must be tested several times. The basic steps are the same. A healthy volunteer fasts overnight. The next morning, he or she drinks a glass of water in which 50 grams of glucose have been dissolved (or, alternately, eats 50 grams of white bread). Over the next two hours, blood samples are taken at regular intervals to measure the rise and fall of glucose. On another day, the same volunteer eats enough of the test foodcooked potato, whole-grain bread, kiwi fruit, ice cream, and so onto consume 50 grams of carbohydrates and sits through another two hours of blood sampling.

Because everyone processes food and responds to glucose a little differently, the glycemic index published in tables is usually the average of eight to ten volunteers. Once a foods glycemic index is in hand, calculating the glycemic load is easy. It involves multiplying the glycemic index by the amount of carbohydrate actually consumed. One-quarter of a cantaloupe, then, with a glycemic index value of 65 and 5.6 grams of carbohydrate, would have a glycemic load of about 3.7 (65 percent times 5.6). A serving of mashed potato, with a glycemic index of 74 and 20 grams of carbohydrate, would have a glycemic load of 15.  How much the food has been processed. Grinding wheat into superfine flour dramatically increases the attack rate of digestive enzymes. Not only does flour have greater surface area than coarsely ground wheat grains, it has been stripped of the protective, hard-to-digest, fibrous outer coat that temporarily fends off enzymes from digesting the starch inside. Regular oatmeal, which is made of smashed oat grains, has a higher glycemic index than oats that are intact or sliced, usually sold as steel-cut oats. Instant oatmeal has an even higher glycemic index.  How much fiber it contains. As indigestible fiber passes through the intestine, it carries along partly digested food, shielding i",

So a food that contains fat may temper the rise in blood sugar.  What else is consumed. Something acidic, like vinegar or lemon juice, can slow the conversion of starch to sugar, as do oils and fats. That means the glycemic index of a whole meal is influenced by the combination of foods that are eaten together. That said, eating a low glycemic food instead of a high glycemic food will lower the impact of the overall meal on blood sugar. INTACT GRAINS, WHOLE GRAINS, AND REFINED GRAINS Various terms are used to describe grain. Here are the key terms that I use. Intact grains are those that have barely been processed, if theyve been processed at all. They look much the same as they did when they were harvested. Whole grains include intact grains and also grains that have been processedground, chopped, steamed, or the likebut nothing has been removed.

Unfortunately, the impurities removed by refining include fiber, vitamins, minerals, and a variety of other beneficial micronutrients and phytochemicals. Lets look at wheat as an example. Wheat is a gigantic relative of the grass that grows in yards and parks all across America. The hollow stem supports a seed head thats tightly packed with many individual grains. Our ancestors often used these grains as they came from the plant, and many people still use these wheat berries with meals or in breakfast porridges. Today, though, most wheat is processed and refined. The milling process first cracks the wheat grains. The starchy, carbohydrate-rich center, called endosperm, is separated from both the dark, fibrous bran and the wheat embryo, called the wheat germ. The endosperm is then pulverized with a series of rollers to make white, powdery flour. If the wheat grain is milled into fine flour without removing the bran and germ, this is technically a whole-grain product, since all the original parts are still present. But it is no longer an intact whole grain. At each stage of milling, something is lost. Removing the germ pulls out unsaturated fats and fat-soluble vitamins. Whacking away the branny outer layer removes fiber, magnesium, and more vitamins. By the time wheat grains have been turned into white flour, the final product is a pale shadow of the original, literally and nutritionally",

Grain Drain. Important nutrients disappear when whole grains are refined. As this bakers dozen shows, the losses can be dramatic. Refined white flour, for example, has barely 5 percent of the vitamin E of whole wheat flour. If intact grains are so healthy, why did we stop eating them and shift to highly refined grains? Its partly a function of perception. Once it became possible to refine wheat, white flour was marketed as being purer than whole-grain flour. At first, white flour was a novelty for the upper classes. The bread and pastries it made were lighter and airier than their whole-grain cousins. In time, buying white flour became a symbol of moving up in the world. The shift was also driven by the reality of storage: white flour, with almost none of the healthy oils found in whole-grain flour, keeps longer. Whole-grain flours must be used more quickly andor refrigerated. For the past four decades, my colleagues and I have been studying the health effects of refined and whole-grain foods with the dedicated help of more than 200,000 women and men participating in the Nurses Health Study, the Nurses Health Study II, and the Health Professionals Follow-Up Study.

WHOLE GRAINS PROTECT AGAINST DIABETES Whole Grains and Weight Control The slower, gentler effects of whole grains on blood sugar and insulin, and the feeling of fullness after eating provided by greater fiber intake, translates into better weight control. My colleagues and I looked at the effects of whole grains in three long-term cohorts of nearly 173,000 men and women. Those who ate several servings of whole grains a day were less likely to have gained weight, or gained less weight, over twenty-four years followup than those who rarely ate whole grains.11 By helping you feel full longer after a meal or snack, whole grains can help you eat less. Roller-coaster blood sugar levels and the loss of fiber-containing bran can affect more than just how fast you get hungry after a meal or snack. They can also influence the development of diabetes. My colleagues and I studied all participants in the Nurses Health Study and the Health Professionals Follow-Up Study who were free of diabetes when we first collected data on diet in the 1980s.

In these studies, eating high-fiber cold breakfast cereal seemed to help reduce the risk of developing diabetes, while consuming soft drinks, white bread, white rice, french fries, and cooked potatoes were all associated with increased risk of diabetes. Developing healthy dietary habits as early as possible, ideally during childhood, is best for long-term health. The good news about preventing diabetes is that no matter how old you are, if you have managed to escape diabetes so far, adopting a healthy diet and physical activity program today will lower your risk starting tomorrow. Thats a terrific immediate return on investment. Other benefits, such as reduced risks of heart disease and cancer, will follow but some may take years to show up.

We estimated that eating a bowl of cold breakfast cereal that supplies about 5 grams of fiber cuts the chance of developing heart disease by about one-third compared with a fiber-free breakfast. The apparent benefit was larger in overweight women than it was in lean women. These benefits have also been seen consistently in other long-term studies of heart disease.

Together, these actions decrease pressure inside the intestinal tract and help prevent diverticular disease. UNCERTAIN EFFECTS ON CANCER Although a number of early studies suggested that higher consumption of whole grains or fiber reduced the odds of developing mouth, stomach, colon, gallbladder, and ovarian cancer, later and larger studies havent consistently borne this out. Analyses from the Nurses Health Study, the Health Professionals Follow-Up Study, and a compilation of large cohort studies from around the world showed that men and women with the highest fiber intake did not have lower risks of colorectal cancer.16 The timing of fiber intake, however, may be important. Among the middle-aged participants of the Nurses Health Study, we saw no relation between fiber intake and risk of breast cancer. In the Nurses Health Study II, which was established to look at diet earlier in life, we found that higher fiber intake during adolescence predicted a lower risk of breast cancer later in life.17 Even if whole-grain, high-fiber foods have no effect on cancer, their impact on heart disease and diabetes is reason enough to eat grains in this form instead of their stripped-down counte",

WHAT MAKES INTACT AND WHOLE GRAINS BETTER? It may be almost impossible to isolate the ingredient or ingredients in whole grains that reduce the risks of heart disease and diabetes. However, a few contenders have been identified. The fiber in whole grains delays absorption of glucose into the bloodstream and eases the workload for insulin-making cells in the pancreas. Fiber helps lower cholesterol levels in the blood. It may also rev up some of the bodys natural anticoagulants and help prevent the formation of small blood clots that trigger heart attacks or strokes. Antioxidants like vitamin E in whole grains prevent cholesterol-containing low-density lipids from reacting with oxygen, a key early step toward the formation of cholesterol-clogged arteries. Phytoestrogens, or plant estrogens, may protect against some cancers. The bran layer of many grains contains essential minerals such as magnesium, selenium, copper, and manganese that may be important in reducing the risk of heart disease and diabetes.

Some so-called low-carb products are ones we have been eating for years that are naturally low in carbohydrates, such as salad dressings and peanut butter, dressed up with new labels. Others have been engineered or reformulated to carry fewer digestible carbohydrates. Companies do this in several ways.

A related condition, called gluten sensitivity or non-celiac gluten sensitivity, can generate symptoms similar to celiac disease but without the intestinal damage. Many people erroneously believe that gluten is harmful to health even among people who dont have celiac disease or evidence of antibodies to gluten. So far, though, theres no evidence from the Nurses Health Study, the Health Professionals Follow-Up Study, or other large cohorts that link high intake of gluten with poorer health.

Food companies are allowed to list synthetic and isolated (purified) fiber on the Nutrition Facts label as plain old fiber. Beginning in 2018, the Food and Drug Administration will require companies to send it documentation that these additives have at least one health benefit, such as a laxative effect, but there may be none of the other benefits that come from eating real fiber from real foods. Take a minute to check the ingredient list to see where the fiber in a food is coming from. If it includes the fake fibers listed above, think about choosing a food with real fiber instead. Here are a few suggestions for adding more intact grains to your diet (see page 272 for more ideas and details). Start slowly and add new grains or products as your appetite grows for these tasty foods: Eat whole grains for breakfast. Make a habit of starting the day with a bowl of whole-grain cereal.

CHAPTER SEVEN Choose Healthier Sources of Protein WE KNOW LESS ABOUT PROTEIN in the diet and the role it plays in health than we do about fats and carbohydrates. This is not because protein is unimportantquite the contrary: its extremely importantbut because it has been studied far less intensively than the other main components of food in relation to long-term health and disease. Much of the focus to date has been on the minimum amount of protein that children need for healthy development and that adults need to keep from slowly breaking down their own tissues. Far less attention has been paid to other important questions, like how much protein is best, if it matters whether your protein comes from animals or plants, and whether a high-protein diet is better for losing or controlling weight than a low-fat, high-carbohydrate diet. Intriguing research on soy and weight loss has kindled new interest in protein that is yielding better information.

Ditto your muscles, the oxygen-carrying hemoglobin in your blood, and the multitude of enzymes that keep you alive and active. In fact, your body is home to at least 10,000 different proteins. Together they make up about 15 percent of your weight. On the molecular level, proteins are long, intricate chains fashioned from just twenty or so basic building blocks called amino acids. Because our bodies are constantly making new proteins, and because we dont store amino acids, we need a near daily supply of protein. Some proteins in food are complete, or high quality. That means they contain all of the twenty-plus types of amino acids needed to make new protein. Others are incomplete, lacking one or more essential amino acids; those are the ones we cant make from scratch or from other amino acids. Meat, poultry, fish, eggs, and dairy foods tend to be good sources of complete proteins, while proteins from plants are often incomplete. Thats why vegetarians need to eat combinations that complement each other, such as rice and beans, peanut butter and bread, and tofu and brown rice. High-Quality Protein: Is Too Much a Bad Thing?",

High-quality or complete protein contains all of the amino acids the body needs to make new proteins. This complete combination of amino acids stimulates growth far better than protein that is missing one or more essential amino acids. Complete protein is perfect for developing babies, children, burn victims, and others who need an extra developmental or growth push. But large amounts of high-quality protein during adulthood may not be needed and may even be harmful. Three essential amino acidsleucine, isoleucine, and valine, the so-called branchedchain amino acidsin high-quality protein turn up production of insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1). This hormone does what its name suggests: stimulates growth. Too much of it, though, increases the risks of developing breast, prostate, and probably other cancers.

But it has been linked to increased risks of several types of cancer, including lymphoma and breast, prostate, colon, and ovarian cancers.1 Later in life, many people lose muscle, which increases the risk of falling and breaking a bone. This happens partly due to lack of exercise and partly due to the falloff in growth hormone production. A growth-promoting boost from high-quality protein at this stage in life may be helpful. HOW MUCH PROTEIN DO YOU NEED? The National Academy of Medicine (formerly known as the Institute of Medicine) set the recommended daily allowance (RDA) for protein at 0.8 grams per kilogram of body weight, or just over 7 grams per 20 pounds. Translated to real body weights, that means 50 grams of protein a day for a 140-pound person and 70 grams for a 200-pound person. (Calculate your daily protein needs here: fnic.nal.usda.govfnicinteractiveDRI.) You can hit this goal almost without thinking, given the abundance of protein-containing foods (see Dietary Sources of Protein on page 136). For example, a serving of yogurt at breakfast, a peanut butter and jelly sandwich for lunch, and a serving of chicken plus rice and beans for dinner adds up to about 85 grams of protein.",

Because it is so easy for us to get protein, its uncommon for healthy adults in this country to have a protein deficiency. Aside from the minimum amount of protein needed to keep the body running, theres little guidance on the ideal amount of dietary protein or the healthiest proportion of calories contributed by protein. Country-to-country comparisons of protein intake and health arent much help because diets around the world tend to have similar amounts of protein. In the average American diet, which we tend to think of as meat-centered, about 15 percent of calories come from protein. In the largely vegetarian, rice-based diets that are common throughout Asia, about 12 percent of calories come from protein. (Rice, which we think of as a carbohydrate, is about 8 percent protein.) Other types of human studies havent paid that much attention to protein. Diet fads further confuse the issue, with competing claims for high-protein, low-carbohydrate diets and low-protein, high-carbohydrate diets. Until theres a good reason to change, getting 7 to 8 grams of protein per 20 pounds of body weight is a good guide for most people, but I dont recommend that you count and track your daily grams of protein.

Protein and cancer. Theres no good evidence that eating a little or a lot of protein influences the risk of cancer in humans. You may have heard about low cancer rates in China or Japan, where the average diet contains a bit less proteinand certainly less animal proteinthan the average American diet. In reality, though, total cancer rates in these countries have traditionally been about the same as they are in the United States, although the types of cancers that are the most common in each country are different.

The International Agency for Research on Cancer, part of the World Health Organization, has concluded that processed meat is carcinogenic to humans, while red meat is probably carcinogenic.3 The link between processed meat consumption and cancer is mainly with colorectal cancer, but connections were also seen between consumption of processed and red meat and pancreatic and prostate cancer.

Gluten, a mixture of proteins found mainly in wheat, rye, and barley, triggers a mistaken immune response in people with celiac disease (see Gluten in Grains: A Danger for Some on page 130). For some reason the immune response recognizes gluten as a foreign invader and attacks it. This attack damages the lining of the small intestine. People with celiac disease cant tolerate any gluten.

Early research raised the theoretical problem that eating a lot of protein could be bad for bones. The digestion of protein releases acids into the bloodstream. At normal levels of protein intake, calcium and other agents in the blood neutralize these acids. With a highprotein diet, however, extra calcium is needed to neutralize these acids. Some experts worried that this neutralizing calcium would be pulled from bone.

How do nuts benefit the heart? There are plenty of possibilities. Their unsaturated fats help lower harmful LDL cholesterol and boost protective HDL cholesterol. One type of unsaturated fat found in walnuts, the omega-3 fatty acid known as alpha-linolenic acid (ALA), seems to help prevent blood clots and potentially deadly erratic heartbeats (see Omega-3 Fats: A Special Benefit on pages 8083). Nuts are also rich in arginine, an amino acid needed to make a tiny but important molecule called nitric oxide. Nitric oxide helps relax blood vessels and ease blood flow. It also makes blood platelets (tiny blood particles that are involved in clotting) less sticky and less likely to form clots in the bloodstream. Vitamin E, folic acid, potassium, fiber, and other phytonutrients found in nuts may also contribute to their heart-health benefits.

Antibiotic Resistance: A New Dietary Hazard For years, doctors were able to turn to a multitude of antibiotics that could stop virtually any type of bacterial infection. No longer. Several strains of bacteria have emerged that are resistant to the antibiotics we currently have. These so-called superbugs have appeared around the world, including in the United States. The use of antibiotics in food production has contributed to the emergence of these superbugs.12 Antibiotics are often given to healthy animals to help them grow faster. Thats a recipe for creating antibiotic resistance. By allowing more opportunity for random mutations, giving healthy animals antibiotics for a long time allows bacteria that become resistant to the antibiotic mutations to thrive. This is truly evolution at work. Recognizing this problem, the FDA announced in 2016 a voluntary program to limit such routine use of antibiotics in food production.13 The majo",

Recognizing this problem, the FDA announced in 2016 a voluntary program to limit such routine use of antibiotics in food production.13 The major poultry producers have indicated they will stop routinely using antibiotics, and some quickly began to use this as a selling point to consumers, touting that their products were raised without antibiotics. Beef and pork producers are finding it harder to do the same thing, because cows and pigs live longer than poultry and they are raised in less sanitary conditions. As a consumer, eating less meat will reduce the likelihood of your taking in antibioticresistant microbes. If you do plan on eating meat, try to find products without antibiotics. Some companies say that on the packaging; others dont. THE SCOOP ON SOY At the turn of the twenty-first century, several research groups turned their attention to soybeans and soy protein.

Soy alone cant counteract a diet thats high in calories and saturated fat, or for lack of exercise. And later studies dont fully back this health claim for soy, with some trials showing that soy protein has little or no effect on cholesterol levels. One problem with the soy research is that in nutrition, the issue of substitutionwhat you choose to eat instead of something you prefer not to eatis vitally important. If you eat a soy food instead of red meat in an entr\u00e9e, say, this will reduce the risk of heart disease, in part because of the much healthier mix of fatty acids in soy than in red meat. Soy and breast cancer. Biologically speaking, theres a good reason why soybeans and soy products may act against cancer. Soybeans are rich in compounds called phytoestrogens, literally plant estrogens. There are two main types of phytoestrogen, isoflavones and lignans. They act a bit like human estrogen, sometimes erroneously called the female hormone. Yet exactly what phytoestrogens do depends on the amount of them and where they are acting. In some tissues phytoestrogens mimic the action of estrogen, while in other tissues they block it. Estrogen stimulates the growth and multiplication of breast and breast cancer cells.",

So the estrogen-blocking effects of soy estrogens could protect against breast cancer. Support for this idea comes from a 2009 cohort study in Shanghai, where soy intake has traditionally been much higher than in the United States.15 In Shanghai, women who ate more soy foods during both childhood and early adult life were less likely to develop breast cancer during their premenopausal years, when natural estrogens are high; no relation was seen for postmenopausal breast cancer. Women with the highest soy protein intakes throughout adolescence and early adulthood had nearly a 60 percent lower risk of premenopausal breast cancer than women with the lowest intakes. In Western populations, little relation has been seen between soy consumption and breast cancer risk, possibly because the amounts of soy eaten by those groups are relatively low. Soy and hot flashes. Menopause is a time of dwindling estrogen production. If the phytoestrogens that are thought to block the effects of estrogen in breast tissue can mimic the effects of estrogen elsewhere in the body, they could provide a natural way to cool hot flashes and ease other problems that plague many women during menopause.

Soy and prostate cancer. Soy foods have also been promoted as a way to prevent prostate cancer by inhibiting the hormones that help this disease grow. A few prospective studies support this idea.17 However, more research is needed, since most of the studies have been small. We know little about how much soy would be needed to prevent prostate cancer and when in life one should start eating it for the biggest payoff. Soy and the brain. Can soy keep your memory sharp as you get older? Its an interesting idea. Naturally falling estrogen levels in both women and men have been suggested as one possible cause of aging-related memory loss and cognitive problems. A few studies, mostly using isoflavone supplements, suggest that getting more soy may preserve memory and thinking skills. Others say that more soy wont make any difference.18 SOY MAY HAVE A DARK SIDE The flip-flopping research on soy and health wouldnt be a huge concern if eating soy protein was completely and totally safe and free of side effects.

One showed that women with a suspicious breast lump who took a soy supplement containing 45 milligrams of isoflavones a day for the fourteen days until a scheduled breast biopsy had biopsies showing more cell growth and division than biopsies from women not taking soy.19 While this might suggest a possible link between soy and risk of breast cancer, the large study from Shanghai that I described earlier, as well as other prospective studies from Asia, provide reassurance that soy does not promote breast cancer. The other, done among older individuals of Japanese ancestry living in Hawaii, showed that those who continued to eat a traditional soy-based diet were more likely to have memory loss and other cognitive problems than those who had made the switch to a more Western diet.20 Similar increases in cognitive problems have been seen in two other reports from Asia, but studies from the United States have generally shown no problems, and even possible benefits, from eating soy foods for maintaining memory.

One thing we know for certain about soy is that the phytoestrogens it contains are potent biological agents. Whether they trigger, suppress, or have no effect on breast cancer, prostate cancer, or memory is unfortunately an open question. Thats why you should treat concentrated soy supplements or isoflavone pills with the same caution you would a totally untested new drug. These findings dont mean to steer you completely clear of soy. Instead, eat it now and then rather than several times a day. PUTTING IT INTO PRACTICE Protein is a key part of any diet. The average person needs about 7 grams of protein a day for every 20 pounds of body weight. Many people can get that amount without any trouble. Whats probably more important for health is the foods you turn to for protein. Red meat, poultry, eggs, fish, milk and dairy foods, and other animal sources can provide plenty of protein.

You also need to pay attention to whats coming along with your protein. A serving of salmon gives you 19 grams of protein plus 2 grams of unhealthy saturated fat and 7.4 grams of healthy unsaturated fats.

Fish, Mercury, and Fish Oil If you like to eat seafood, or think you should eat more of it, you may feel youre caught between the devil and the deep blue sea. Fish is a great choice for many reasons: it tastes good, its a healthier source of protein than red meat, and the omega-3 fats in most types of seafood help the heart. Yet some species contain mercury, polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), and other contaminants. Should you stop eating fish? Cut back? Hold the line? The answer depends on who you are.

What about PCBs, which were banned in the 1970s but are still present in the environment? High doses kill fish and cause cancer in laboratory rats. Low doses may cause subtle developmental problems in babies. Studies in adults havent linked PCBs to cancer or other diseases. To be on the safe side, children and women of childbearing age should stay away from high-mercury fish like shark, swordfish, king mackerel, and tilefish (sometimes called golden snapper or golden bass). Its also wise to avoid eating fish caught near industrial areas, where PCBs are likely to be most abundant. Safe choices include cod, haddock, salmon, sardines, shrimp, and tilapia.

The odds are high that the benefits I listed for fruits and vegetables emanate from many different substances found in plants and quite possibly from the interactions among them. Why Supplements Are Not a Substitute for Fruits and Vegetables So far, no one has found a magic bullet that works as well as fruits and vegetables against heart disease, cancer, and a host of other chronic diseases. In theory, one could cram all of the good things that plants makeessential elements, fiber, vitamins, antioxidants, plant hormones, and so oninto a pill. But it would have to be a very large pill, and scientists honestly cant say they know exactly what should go into it. Or in what proportions. Take the antioxidant pigments known as carotenoids. When you eat a tomato or carrot, the different carotenoids it contains eventually work their way into different types of cells and different parts of each cell. This offers antioxidant protection throughout the cell and to a wide variety of cell types.

This isnt to say that vitamin and mineral supplements are worthless. As described in chapter eleven, vitamin supplements are excellent insurance. But they arent a substitute for a healthy diet.

It cant give you the earthy smell and taste of a fresh ear of corn, the sweetness of a juicy tomato still warm from the afternoon sun, the crunch of an apple, the festive green of a snap pea or broccoli floret, or the smooth, nutty taste of an avocado. Stick with real fruits and vegetables: they contain a bounty of phytochemicals that do not come in capsules, and they taste better too. BUT FIRST, EXACTLY WHAT ARE FRUITS AND VEGETABLES? To a botanist, a fruit is any plant part that contains seeds. By the process of elimination, a vegetable is everything else: leaves, stems, flowers, roots, and bulbs.

In this book, I will stick with the culinary concept of fruits as sweet, dessert-or even snack-like foods, and vegetables as savory, salad-or dinner-type foods. Fruit or Vegetable? The argument over whether certain foods are fruits or vegetables has been around for years. Back in 1893, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that tomatoes were a vegetable, and theyve remained so ever since. Why was the highest court in the land asked to make a legal and somewhat unscientific rule like that? Fruit importers John, George, and Frank Nix sued New Yorks collector of customs taxes, Edward Hedden, to recover taxes he had levied on a shipment of tomatoes the Nixes had imported from the West Indies. Back then, imported fruits werent taxed, while vegetables were. In its decision, the Court acknowledged that tomatoes were technically fruits. But in the common language of the people the Court determined that tomatoes, as well as cucumbers, squashes, beans, and peas, are vegetables which are grown in kitchen gardens and are usually served at dinner with the main part of the meal and not as dessert.1 I am not including potatoes and corn in the vegetable category, even though they are among the most popular vegetables in America (see The Spud Is a Dud on page 167).

FAMILY NUTRITION When studying the connection between fruits, vegetables, and health, it helps to talk about groups of plants. One of the most common classification schemes is by plant family. Those you usually find in the market or on the table include the following:  The crucifer family (Cruciferae) gets its name from the tiny cross you can see if you look at a recently sprouted seed. It includes a number of those vegetables that children (and some adults) instinctively but unwisely avoidbroccoli, Brussels sprouts, cabbage, cauliflower, collard greens, kale, kohlrabi, mustard greens, radishes, rutabaga, turnips, and watercress. Some members of the crucifer family are excellent sources of isothiocyanates, indoles, thiocyanates, and nitriles. These chemicals may protect against breast and some other types of cancer.  The melonsquash family (Cucurbitaceae) includes cucumbers, summer squashes such as pumpkin and zucchini, winter squashes such as acorn and butternut, cantaloupes, and honeydew melons.  The heath or heather family (Ericaceae) gives us cranberries, blueberries, lingonberries, and more. These fruits are particularly high in a flavonoid called anthocyanin, which may be linked to the prevention of diabetes, heart disease, and dementia.  The legume family (Leguminosae) includes alfalfa sprouts, beans, peas, and soybeans.",

The lily family (Liliaceae) includes asparagus, chives, garlic, leeks, onions, and shallots. These vegetables contain a number of sulfur-containing compounds, especially allicin and diallyl sulfate, that may fight cancer.  The rose family (Rosaceae) includes almonds, apples, apricots, cherries, peaches, pears, plums, raspberries, and strawberries.  The citrus family (Rutaceae) encompasses grapefruits, lemons, limes, oranges, and tangerines. Citrus fruits are high in vitamin C and the carotenoid betacryptoxanthin and also contain the compounds limonene and coumarin, which have been shown to have anticancer properties in laboratory animals.  The solanum family (Solanaceae) is a diverse group that includes eggplant, peppers, potatoes, and tomatoes. Tomatoes contain high amounts of lycopene, a type of antioxidant that may play a key role in preventing prostate and other cancers.  The umbels (Umbelliferae) include carrots, celeriac, celery, parsley, and parsnips. Carrots are an excellent source of beta-carotene, which the body uses to make vitamin A.

Yet the use of olive oil is as all-American as the founding fathers. Heres what Thomas Jefferson had to say about the olive tree and olive oil in a letter to William Drayton, a South Carolina lawyer, congressman, and planter: The olive is a tree the least known in America, and yet the most worthy of being known. Of all the gifts of heaven to man, it is next to the most precious, if it be not the most precious. Perhaps it may claim a preference even to bread, because there is such an infinitude of vegetables which it renders a proper and comfortable nourishment. Our third president knew something that cooks and chefs have rediscoveredthat olive oil can perk up vegetables and other foods. Jefferson, a curious naturalist and ardent horticulturalist, repeatedly tried to cultivate olive trees in South Carolina and Georgia, but with little success.

Daily consumption is just as limited, hovering around four servings a day, and that figure is vastly inflated by potatoes. A recent national survey showed that only 1 in 9 Americans gets the minimum recommended daily dose of five servings of fruits and vegetables a day.2 That limited consumption is a pity, given the clear-cut benefits of eating fruits and vegetables.

A diet that includes plenty of fruits and vegetables can help control or even prevent high blood pressure and high cholesterol, two of the main precursors of heart disease and stroke. Even better, investing in a plant-rich diet pays off in terms of lower chances of developing several forms of heart disease and stroke. High blood pressure often sets the stage for stroke, heart attack, and other kinds of circulatory problems. High blood pressure, formally known as hypertension, affects more than 70 million Americans and a staggering 1 billion people worldwide.3 Its increasingly common with age: under 10 percent of U.S. adults between the ages of twenty and thirty-four have high blood pressure, compared to more than 75 percent of those over age seventy-five. Up to 90 percent of Americans develop high blood pressure over their lifetimes. Sometimes called the silent killer, high blood pressure causes no real symptoms. Thats one reason at least one-third of people with it dont know they have it. Of those who are well aware they have high blood pressure, many have a hard time keeping it under control. The effect on blood pressure of adding more fruits and vegetables to your diet, while not quite as huge as comes from exercise, is well worth the small effort.

Other reviews and meta-analyses have shown that eating about thirty servings of fruits and vegetables a week (or just under five a day) was associated with a 30 percent lower risk of the most common type of stroke (ischemic stroke), the kind caused by a blood clot blocking an artery in, or to, the brain.5 My colleagues and I calculated that eating one extra serving of fruits or vegetables a day decreases the chances of having an ischemic stroke by about 6 percent. In that study, most of the benefit seemed to come from eating broccoli, spinach, kale, romaine lettuce, and citrus fruit or juice. Many nutrients in these foods contribute to the lower risk of stroke. One of them is folate, the plant form of folic acid (the terms are derived from the word foliage).

The beauty of the DASH method was that all of the volunteers meals during the study were specially prepared in hospital kitchens, a strategy that minimized variation from person to person. After eight weeks, the combination diet (fruits and vegetables plus three servings of dairy) substantially lowered blood pressure among the volunteers who had high blood pressure.

A second DASH trial showed that a low-salt version of the DASH diet can subtract a few extra points from blood pressure (see chapter eleven). Many components of the DASH diet contribute to its ability to lower blood pressure. A follow-up study showed that the single most important factor is the extra potassium provided by the fruits and vegetables. Cholesterol levels also seem to respond to a diet with plenty of fruits and vegetables. This may be one of the ways that fruits and vegetables reduce the risk of heart disease and stroke. No one knows for sure how fruits and vegetables lower cholesterol. Since eating more plant foods often means eating less meat and dairy products, lower cholesterol levels may come from eating less saturated fat. They could also be due to the ability of soluble fiber to block the absorption of cholesterol from food.

People who regularly eat dark green leafy vegetables like spinach and collard greens are less likely to develop two common aging-related eye diseases, cataract and macular degeneration. Together, these two afflict millions of Americans over age sixty-five. A cataract is the gradual clouding of the eyes lens, a disk of protein that focuses light on the light-sensitive retina. Like clear floor wax that turns dull and cloudy from the pounding and scuffling of feet, decades of insults damage and cloud the lens. Macular degeneration, the leading cause of blindness among older people, is caused by cumulative damage to the macula, the center of the retina. It starts as a blurred spot in the center of what you see. As the degeneration spreads, vision shrinks. In both diseases, free radicals are believed to be responsible for causing much of the damage. Free radicals are highly reactive and out-of-control substances generated inside the eye by bright sunlight, cigarette smoke, air pollution, and infection. Dark green leafy vegetables contain two pigments, lutein and zeaxanthin, that accumulate in the eye. These two, along with phytochemicals called carotenoids, can snuff out free radicals before they can harm the eyes sensitive tissues.8 Getting lutein and zeaxanthin from fruits and vegetables is probably better than taking them",

What you cant digest of fruits and vegetables is as healthful as what you can. As I describe later (see Fiber: Praise for the Indigestible, page 161), fiber, or what some call roughage, is essential for healthy bowel function. Without enough indigestible material in the diet, stools can become hard and difficult to pass. Fiber sops up water like a sponge and expands as it moves through the digestive system. This can calm the irritable bowel. By prompting regular bowel movements, fiber can relieve or prevent constipation. The bulking and softening actions of fiber also decrease pressure inside the intestinal tract and so may help prevent diverticulosis (the development of tiny, easily irritated pouches inside the colon) and diverticulitis (the often painful inflammation of these pouches). Almost twenty years ago, my colleagues and I found that men who ate more fiber were less likely to develop symptoms of diverticular disease.9 This was recently confirmed in a six-year study of nearly 700,000 women in the United Kingdom.10 . . .

Fast Fact: A Shout Out for Blueberries In our analyses of connections between specific fruits and vegetables and disease risk, one group of foods kept rising to the top: berries. Several studies have linked eating these tasty fruits, especially blueberries, to lower risks of heart disease, memory loss, diabetes, estrogen-receptor negative breast cancer, Parkinsons disease, and more. Berries are no miracle food, mind you, and eating them cant undo the harms caused by less-thanhealthful food choices. But sprinkled on cereal, added to a fruit salad, munched as a snack, and turned into low-sugar desserts, berries can be a terrific addition to your diet. So far, several hundred studies have looked at the connection between diets high (or low) in fruits and vegetables and the development of cancer.

Such comparisons arent always fair or without bias. People with cancer, for example, tend to seek reasons why they were stricken and may be more apt to find fault with their diets than those without the disease. The consistency of results from case-control studies created a deceptively strong idea that eating plenty of fruits and vegetables helped ward off cancer. Cohort studies, in which information on diet and other lifestyle factors are collected before cancer, heart disease, and other conditions occur, tend to give more reliable and durable results. More than a decade ago, my team at the Harvard School of Public Health combined information on fruits and vegetables and cancer from our two large cohort studies, the Nurses Health Studies and Health Professionals Follow-Up Study, after the 110,000 participants had been followed for almost twenty years. During this time, 9,100 had developed some type of cancer.

No. Although they dont have a blanket anticancer effect, some specific fruits and vegetables may work against specific cancers. Drill down a bit into the data and theres some evidence that certain types of fruits or vegetables work against specific cancers. Examples include the following:  Bladder cancer. Eating cruciferous vegetables like broccoli has been linked with lower rates of bladder cancer.  Breast cancer. One problem with studying breast cancer is that it isnt a single disease. It is several different diseases, each with its own risk factors. One type, estrogen-receptor-negative breast cancer, is particularly aggressive and more likely to be deadly. By combining data from cohort studies around the world, my team was able to examine breast cancers by their estrogen receptor status and found that consuming more vegetables was linked to a lower risk of developing estrogen-receptor-negative breast cancer.15 Eating broccoli and other cruciferous vegetables has been linked to lower risk of developing breast ca",

There is strong evidence that the vitamin folate (also called folic acid) helps protect against colon and rectal cancer. Vegetables such as spinach and beets are good sources of folic acid and so can help fight these cancers. Today, though, with so many foods fortified with folic acid (see chapter eleven), the contribution of this vitamin from fruits and vegetables to protection against colon and rectal cancer may be dwindling.  Prostate cancer. Lycopene from tomatoes and cooked or processed tomato products, such as tomato sauce and ketchup, seems to be involved in the prevention of prostate cancer. In the Health Professionals Follow-Up Study, for example, men who consumed several servings of tomatoes, tomato sauce, or tomato juice a week were less likely to develop advanced prostate cancer than those who ate one to two servings a week.17 This finding has been supported by studies that look at blood levels of lycopene and other carotenoids.

So do habits like smoking cigarettes, drinking too much alcohol, getting too much sun, and not exercising. Your occupation may also play a role. Still, a nutritious dietand that includes plenty of fruits and vegetablesis an important part of any stay-healthy strategy. FIBER: PRAISE FOR THE INDIGESTIBLE From a health standpoint, one of the wonderful things about eating fruits and vegetables is that they contain much you cant digest. Many of the substances that give plants their strength and flexibility arent broken down by the acids and enzymes in the human stomach or intestines. These substances, generically called fiber, include cellulose, pectin, and gums. There are two classes of fiber, soluble and insoluble. Both pass through the digestive system largely untouched.

It forms a sticky, gooey, Jell-Olike mass as it passes through the intestines. This gummy substance traps cholesterol-rich bile acids and carries them out of the body in the stool. The more cholesterol you excrete, the less is available for transfer into the blood and the more your cholesterol will be lowered. The lower your cholesterol, the lower your risk of heart disease and other circulatory problems. Insoluble fiber comes from the cell walls of plants. The main component is cellulose, a long string of glucose molecules linked in a way the human digestive system cant separate and that cant dissolve in the intestines fluids. Several decades ago, research among the Bantu people of South Africa suggested that their highfiber diet was responsible for their low rate of colon cancer. As insoluble fiber passes unchanged through the intestine, so the thinking went, it carries along partly digested food, and by speeding the passage of food through the digestive system, it may reduce the intestines exposure to toxic or cancer-causing substances found in food. After a few small studies showed much the same thing, the fiber craze was on.

Also, in two randomized trials in which fiber supplements and a high-fiber, low-fat diet were compared with control groups, higher fiber intake didnt reduce the recurrence of new polyps. Taking these findings together, high-fiber diets dont appear to be an effective way to prevent colon cancer. Despite the disappointments for colon cancer, dont throw out the All-Bran and stock up on Wonder Bread. By dragging partly digested food through the intestines, insoluble fiber delays the absorption of sugars and starch. This helps blunt the spikes in blood sugar and insulin that occur after eating foods that are easily converted into glucose and a similar spike in triglycerides, particles that ferry fat from the intestines to the tissues.

The vast community of microbes that live in your digestive system, called your gut microbiome, helps digest food as it passes through your intestines. It also makes certain vitamins, breaks down toxins, and trains your immune system. Your microbiome plays an important role in keeping you healthy or making you sick, and may help control your weight or nudge you toward gaining weight. A powerful way to keep your microbiome in shape is to feed it plenty of fiber, a preferred food of gut microbes. This promotes what is believed to be the healthiest mix of microbes. Over the past decade or so, research in animals has shown that adding more fiber to the diet can change the community of microbes from one that promotes weight gain to one that is linked to a leaner physique. Fiber-starved microbes in the gut can start to feed on the protective mucus that lines the gut, which may trigger inflammation and disease. How well this applies to humans is a hot area of research.

Although weve been eating plants for eons and seriously studying them for decades, what we know today is the proverbial tip of the iceberg. Identifying the benefits of fruits and vegetables has been a challenging job, especially since plants have tremendous nutritional variability. A single type of plant say, a Macoun appleisnt a stable, well-defined entity. Instead its chemical composition varies with the season, the soil in which it grew, the amount of water it got, what pests it had to withstand, how ripe it was when picked and eaten, and under what conditions it was stored. Whats more, the nutrients it delivers depend on how it is processed or cooked. It will be decades before we have identified all of the complex compounds in food and even longer before we truly understand how they interact with one another and what they do in our bodies. Even so, scientists have isolated a number of substances that plants make or store that may play critical roles in keeping us healthy. These include the following: Vitamins.

Vitamins have traditionally been defined by studying diseases of deficiency, things like rickets (too little vitamin D), pellagra (not enough niacin), and beriberi (not enough thiamine). More and more it looks as though cancer, heart disease, stroke, diabetes, osteoporosis, and other chronic diseases are, in part, diseases of deficiency. Exactly what the deficiencies are is the focus of intense research. Inadequate intake of folic acid is a likely risk factor for cardiovascular disease and some cancers. Low consumption of a special class of vitamins known as antioxidants, which capture and neutralize free radicals, appears to be involved in the early stages of heart disease, cancer, agingrelated eye disease, dementia, and possibly aging itself (see chapter eleven). Perhaps some of the known or yet-to-be-discovered phytochemicals will earn vitamin status for preventing these diseases.

Another group, the phytosterols, can influence the absorption and metabolism of cholesterol. Carotenoids. These pigments give plants their orange or reddish colors.

They probably relied on a wide variety of fruits and vegetables, scrabbling to pick and eat whatever edible morsels they could find.

TOO MUCH OF A GOOD THING Could eating too much of some kinds of fruits or vegetables be bad for you? The answer is yes. Almost all essential nutrients can be toxic if you take in too much of them. That cautionary note likely applies to fruits and vegetables as well. Legendary biochemist Bruce Ames once pointed out that plants evolved to make chemicals that are toxic to insects and other animals that might eat them, or to ward off infections by bacteria, yeast, and other organisms.21 Many of these chemicals are natural carcinogens when tested, but, as Ames pointed out, we have evolved multiple detoxification mechanisms to protect us. It is possible that some of these plantmade agents will slip through our defenses. And we have also altered the chemical content of the foods we eat, especially fruits and vegetables, by selective breeding for many characteristics, such as sweetness, that could increase the natural carcinogens. Here are a few examples of potential harms: Too much spinach. This green leafy vegetable is a healthful, versatile plant. You can eat it raw in salads, use it as a bed for salmon, or saut\u00e9 it as a side dish. But spinach is quite high in oxalates.

You might also eat cheese or some other dairy food along with spinach, because these foods reduce the absorption of oxalates. Grapefruit juice. This popular juice contains potent compounds that alter the metabolism of many drugs. Depending on the drug, these changes can lead to too much or too little of the drug in the bloodstream (see Juice on page 174).

Many people like the edgy bitterness of this cruciferous vegetable. But this bitterness is sometimes a signal of potentially cancercausing chemicals. In a pooled analysis of cohort studies, my colleagues and I saw a modest increase in pancreatic cancer among people consuming Brussels sprouts three times a week.23 In a separate analysis, high consumption of Brussels sprouts was also linked to a higher risk of developing high blood pressure.24 If you think about the unusual shape of the Brussels sprout, the tight packages of leaves that we eat emerge from the stalk, which would normally be covered with bark or spines for protection.",

Because potatoes are such a huge commodity, they have received special treatment from the USDA and from politicians. The potato is one of several starchy vegetables mentioned by name in the Dietary Guidelines for Americans. The USDA has said that batter-coated frozen potatoes the ones used to make french friescan be classified as a fresh vegetable. Congress even promoted potatoes a few years back when senators from Maine, Idaho, and other potato-growing states, backed by the National Potato Council, added potatoes to the list of vegetables that could be bought with vouchers from the federal Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC). The 2014 omnibus appropriations bill directed the USDA to allow all varieties of fresh, whole, or cut vegetables to be part of the WIC program, which included white potatoes and french fries.

Potatoes are a good source of potassium, which can help reduce blood pressure. They also have a high glycemic load (see page 118), which can boost blood pressure and increase the risk of diabetes.

But he was able to tolerate their glycemic load in a way most sedentary Americans cant today.

And it forms the watery highways that transport nutrients, wastes, hormones, and other substances throughout your body. When it comes to fluids, the constant struggle for survival can be reduced to this: you dry, you die. Your skin, kidneys, nasal passages, and several hormones work together to keep the fluid part of you from drifting off into the air. But preventing water loss isnt enough. You need to take in enough fluid to carry out a variety of critical metabolic tasksthings like making urine to flush away toxic by-products of digestion and metabolism, maintaining blood volume, and preventing body salts from getting too concentrated, as well as replenishing whatever water you lose. The average person uses about a milliliter of fluid for every calorie burned. Thats about 64 ounces for a 2,000-calorie-a-day diet. Exactly how much fluid you need to take in each day depends on you.

Thats a medical myth, one of those facts that is repeated so often it gains the ring of truth.1 Where it came from no one really knows. One possible source is the physiological requirement that burning 2,000 calories worth of food a day requires about 64 ounces of water. Another is a 1945 report by the National Food and Nutrition Board (under the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine) that included this recommendation: A suitable allowance of water for adults is 2.5 liters daily in most instances.2 Two point five liters is a little more than eight 8-ounce glasses.",

Thats especially true when you are working or playing hard and losing water quickly. Aging tends to uncouple the sense of thirst from the bodys fluid level, and many older people become dehydrated without realizing it. Urine color is influenced by what you eat and some vitamin supplements. The consequences of not taking in enough fluid each day range from the merely irritating to the life-threatening. Minor dehydration can make you feel grumpy and tired. Chronic minor dehydration is a cause of constipation, especially among older people. It can also contribute to the development of kidney stones and bladder cancer. Extreme dehydration, though relatively uncommon, can be deadly. It occurs mostly among children and older people during very hot weather, and among endurance athletes. Overhydration can be a problem too.

Think of hydration as a day-long process. Drink at least one glass of your beverage of choice soon after arising, with each meal, and in between meals. Drink before and after exercising. And drink if you are feeling thirsty. So far I have been deliberately general in talking about fluid intake rather than specifying any specific beverage.

So far, the available evidence doesnt support that as serious health threat. To be on the safe side, though, we need to invest in public water treatment facilities that minimize the levels of these compounds. Many people believe that bottled water is safer than tap water. Thats not necessarily true. In fact, some bottled water actually comes from the tap, not from the pristine mountain springs conjured up by their names or the images on their labels. Bottled water doesnt have to meet standards set by the federal Environmental Protection Agency that require regular testing for bacterial and chemical contamination. Tap water from public supplies, by comparison, must meet those standards and the reports must be made public. Theres also a widespread belief that bottled water tastes better than tap water. In blind taste tests, though, tap water often comes out on top. There are certainly exceptions, as some water systems have chlorine levels that give the water an off taste.

Getting that much from bottled water would cost two hundred times more (about 225) if its from large home-delivery bottles or four hundred times more (500) if it comes from individual bottles. There are also environmental considerations. It takes as much water to make disposable, individual-size water bottles as the bottle contains. Transporting bottled water uses fossil fuels and contributes to global warming. And many of the billions of bottles consumed each year in the United States end up in landfills or incinerators. The bottom line is that our public water supplies are generally very safe and that chlorination has saved countless lives by blocking the spread of infectious diseases. If there are risks to drinking tap water, they are generally very low compared with other hazardous habits. That said, some city water can be a health hazard, as weve sadly seen in Flint, Michigan. In such cases, drinking bottled water is an inexpensive and healthy alternative to drinking soda, juice, or other beverages in place of tap water.

In fact, scurvy, a disabling condition caused by a deficiency of vitamin C, was eliminated in the United States after World War II in part by the tradition of having a small glass of orange juice with breakfast. Orange juice also happens to be a good source of beta-cryptoxanthin, a healthful carotenoid that would otherwise be low in our diet. As a regular beverage, though, fruit juice can add a hefty daily dose of calories (see Beware of liquid calories on page 65). A 12-ounce serving of orange juice, for example, gives you 150 calories or so, or the equivalent of three chocolate-chip cookies or a can of sugar-sweetened soda. Thats an awful lot of calories if you just need something to quench your thirst. The fundamental problem with drinking juice is that it is just too easy to consume a large amount of fruitand its accompanying sugarin a few moments. Think of squeezing your own oranges to make a glass of juice. This would require about three oranges, depending on their size. Almost no one would eat three whole oranges at a sitting; spacing them out over a day would have a very gentle effect on your blood glucose.

The danger of drinking sugared sodas and juices instead of water is that many people treat liquid calories as somehow different from food calories and often dont make up for the calories in soda or juice by eating less. The simple sugars in soda trigger rapid and intense increases in blood sugar, which causes the pancreas to pump out more and more insulin.

Lactose intolerance. All babies are born with the ability to digest milk. Some, especially those of northern European ancestry, keep this trait for life. Most children, though, gradually lose it as their bodies stop making an enzyme called lactase that breaks down milk sugar (lactose). In fact, only about a quarter of the worlds adults can fully digest milk. In the United States, as many as 50 million Americans arent equipped to digest milk. Half of Hispanic Americans, 75 percent of African Americans, and more than 90 percent of Asian Americans cant tolerate much lactose.

Saturated fat. An 8-ounce glass of whole milk contains almost 5 grams of saturated fat. Drinking three glasses a day would be the equivalent of eating twelve strips of bacon or a Big Mac and an order of fries. Thats a substantial amount of saturated fat. Cheese can also deliver a lot of saturated fat. A 1ounce serving of American cheese made from whole milk delivers about as much calcium as a glass of milk and the same amount of saturated fat.

If you are aiming to optimize your health, replacing butter and other sources of dairy fat with unsaturated plant oils is a good step in that direction. That isnt to say that you should entirely eliminate milk, cheese, and ice cream. If you really like them, eat them in modest amounts, buy the best quality you can afford, and enjoy them. You might think that if enough people made the switch to low-fat or skim milk, lower rates of heart disease would follow. But that wont happen, at least not at the population level. Thats because once a cow is milked, the fat from that milk is in the food supply, and someone ends up drinking or eating it. Much of the fat skimmed from milk resurfaces as butter and cream, which are used to make premium ice cream, buttery pastries, and high-fat snack foods such as cookies and candy bars.

Three glasses of whole milk a day add 450 calories to your diet nearly one-quarter of the average persons recommended daily intake. Lowfat milk, at 330 calories, adds a bit fewer, but that is still a lot of calories if the main goal is just to get more calcium. Extra hormones. Cows make most of the same hormones that humans make. Before farming turned into agribusiness, the hormone levels in milk werent an issue. Today, though, they may well be a cause for concern. Over the years, dairy cattle have been bred to produce more milk. Since 1960, American Holstein cows genetic potential for milk production has increased nearly 7,000 pounds after each birth. Cows today are routinely milked while they are pregnant, which also keeps milk production high. This is great for cattle farmers and milk producers, and it helps keep the price of milk relatively low. But it also means that todays milk contains a more concentrated mix of hormones than it did years ago. Naturally occurring hormones in milk include estrogens and progestins (so-called female hormones), testosterone and other androgens (so-called male hormones), and insulin-like growth factor, to name just a few. Estrogens and progestins can stimulate breast cancer, testosterone and androgens can promote prostate cancer, and elevated levels of insulin-like growth factor have been",

The participants complete questionnaires on diet, exercise, lifestyle factors, and health, much as their mothers do. In this group, teenage acne, a largely hormone-driven condition, is more common among milk drinkers.12 This is important, because it suggests that the hormones in milk are strong enough or abundant enough to stimulate glandular tissue such as the sebaceous glands in the skinand possibly mammary glands in the breast. Low-fat and skim milk were more strongly associated with acne than whole milk. Thats probably because removing fat from milk also removes fat-soluble female hormones (estrogens), which tend to counter the acne-driving effects of water-soluble male hormones (androgens), which are left behind.

A diet high in milk or dairy foods has been implicated as a risk factor for prostate cancer. In a meta-analysis of thirty-two cohort studies, total dairy foods, milk, low-fat milk, and cheese were all significantly associated with a higher risk of prostate cancer.13 In the most detailed of these studies, the Health Professionals Follow-Up Study, men who drank two or more glasses of milk a day were almost twice as likely to develop advanced or metastatic (spreading) prostate cancer as those who didnt drink milk at all. Whats the connection? Drinking milk increases blood levels of insulinlike growth factor 1, which has been linked to higher risk of prostate cancer. This growth factor is whats partly responsible for helping children and teens grow taller. It continues to rev up cell multiplication throughout life. But it also stimulates the growth of cancer cells. Its possible that calcium contributes to the excess risk of prostate cancer too.

Too much calcium slows or even stops the conversion of inactive vitamin D to its biologically active form and so may rob the body of a natural anticancer mechanism. Uterine cancer. Endometrial cancer, the glandular form of cancer affecting the uterus, is strongly promoted by higher estrogen levels, whether they are naturally produced or result from medication. Because of concerns about the naturally occurring hormone levels in milk, we examined milk consumption and risk of this cancer in the Nurses Health Study. Overall, there was a modest increase in risk with greater milk consumption. But among postmenopausal women not taking hormone medications, there was a 60 percent higher risk when the women consumed three or more servings of dairy foods per day.14 This finding adds to evidence that the hormone levels in milk are high enough to be biologically important.

Drinking milk during childhood and adolescence, however, may be a different story. Children and adolescents who drink a lot of milk tend to be taller than those who dont drink much milk, and greater height has been linked to an increased risk of cancers of the breast, colon, and other sites.16 Today we have limited data directly relating consumption of milk during childhood and adolescence to risk of cancers during adulthood, but the potential for increases in risk suggest caution over high dairy consumption during these formative years. Fractures. As noted in chapter ten, the observation that rates of hip fractures are highest in countries with the greatest milk consumption has been a longstanding paradox. Because of the provocative finding that being tall is associated with increased risks of many cancers, we explored our data on diet during adolescence in the Growing Up Today Study to identify the aspects of diet that were most strongly predictive of gain in height and ultimately attained height.

Fortunately, we had the data to test this idea, because we had asked participants in our adult cohort studies about their milk consumption during high school. As expected, their reported milk consumption during high school correlated with their adult height and in men also predicted higher risk of hip fracture later in life. The risk increased by 9 percent for each additional glass of milk per day.19 Among women, we didnt see an increase or a decrease in hip fractures with milk consumption, possibly because height is determined earlier in girls than in boys.

Hidden Calories in Coffee Drinks All by itself, coffee is a very low calorie drink: an 8-ounce cup contains just 2 calories. Adding a spoonful of sugar and a tablespoon of cream turns that into a 50-calorie beverage. Drinking that three times a day is like drinking one sugar-sweetened soda. Without cutting back on calories elsewhere, that could translate into packing on 15 extra pounds over the course of a year. The real caloric danger comes from specialty mochas, lattes, and blended coffee drinks. These are often supersized and can contain 500 calories or more.

ALCOHOL Public health campaigns have traditionally urged people to cut back on their drinking or to avoid alcohol altogether. Concerns about alcohol are definitely justified. Alcohol is implicated in about one-third of all deadly traffic accidents. Heavy drinking is a major cause of preventable deaths in the United States. It contributes to liver disease, a variety of cancers, high blood pressure, so-called bleeding strokes, and a progressive weakening of the heart and other muscles. Too much alcohol can dissolve the best of intentions and the closest relationships. Alcohol in moderation, though, can have benefits. A drink before a meal can improve digestion or offer a soothing respite at the end of a stressful day, and the occasional drink with friends can be a social tonic. These physical and psychic effects may improve health and well-being. Well-documented benefits exist for most adults who are middle-aged or older.

There is good evidence that these and other effects of moderate alcohol consumption translate into protection against heart disease and ischemic strokes, and much evidence that it protects against diabetes and gallstones. Keep in mind that these benefits are almost exclusively for (and mostly harm) younger individuals. What does moderate alcohol drinking actually mean? Thats a tricky question and a topic that is the focus of intense research. For men, study after study has shown that men who have one or two alcoholic drinks a day are 30 to 40 percent less likely to have heart attacks than men who dont drink alcohol at all. Thats about the same reduction in risk seen with the powerful cholesterol-lowering drugs known as statins. For men with diabetes, who are at very high risk of developing heart disease, a drink or two a day has similar benefits. More than two drinks a day further increases heart and stroke protection but also increases the chances that the dark side of alcohol will emerge (see Figure 18). Figure 18. Alcohol and Death.

So, as I discuss in chapter eleven, taking a multivitamin that contains folic acid is especially important if you drink alcohol. For both men and women, even moderate drinking carries some risks. Alcohol can disrupt sleep. Its ability to disrupt judgment is renowned. Alcohol, particularly in higher amounts, interacts in potentially dangerous ways with a variety of medications, including acetaminophen, antidepressants, anticonvulsants, painkillers, and sedatives. It is also addictive, especially among people with a family history of alcoholism. So who might benefit from a daily alcoholic drink? Alcohol offers little benefit and potential risks for a pregnant woman and her unborn child, a recovering alcoholic, a person with liver disease, and individuals taking one or more medications that interact with alcohol.",

Some researchers suggested that red wine was the answer, something the wine industry heavily and heartily endorsed. But red wine wasnt the only reason for lower heart disease rates in France. The overall diet and lifestyle in parts of the country, especially in the south, have much in common with other Mediterranean regions, and these almost certainly account for some of the protection against heart disease. More recent studies show that any alcohol-containing beverage offers the same benefits. Red or white wine, beer, cordials, or spirits such as gin or Scotch whiskey all seem to have the same effect on cardiovascular disease. Claims that the small amounts of resveratrol and other antioxidants found in red wine and grape juice prevent heart disease have yet to be proved; if they do indeed offer any extra benefit, it is likely to be small. An individuals drinking pattern seems to be more important than the type of alcoholic beverage.

Now that these benefits are well proven and durable, I offer these more concrete guidelines:  If you dont drink alcohol, dont feel compelled to start: you can get similar benefits by beginning to exercise (if you dont already) or boosting the intensity and duration of your activity.  If you do drink alcohol, keep it moderate.  A drink a day three or more times a week is far, far better for you than three or more drinks one day a week.  If you are a man with no history of alcoholism who is at moderate to high risk for heart disease, a daily alcoholic drink may help reduce that risk.  If you are a woman with no history of alcoholism, benefits of a drink a day may be counterbalanced by a modest increase in your chances of developing breast cancer. Getting enough folic acid (at least 400 milligrams per day) may reduce this increase in risk (see chapter eleven).

PUTTING IT INTO PRACTICE What you drink over the course of the day and your lifetime can affect your health as much as what you eat. From a purely physiological point of view, you need to drink beverages to replace the water you lose. It makes the most sense to drink water when you have a choice. Other beverages are perfectly fine as long as they dont add many calories to your diet.  Hydration is a day-long process. Drink at least one glass of your beverage of choice with each meal, and one or more in between meals. Boost your fluid consumption if you are physically active or if you find yourself urinating infrequently.  Drink sugar-sweetened beverages such as sodas, fruit drinks, and sports drinks only occasionally, if at all. Their liquid calories can help you unintentionally pack on extra pounds. Limit 100 percent fruit juices to one glass a day or, even better, eat the fruit whole instead of drinking its juice.  Adults dont need to drink milk. Think of it as an optional part of your diet, not something you need to drink two or three times a day.  Coffee and tea are healthy beverages. Just dont overload them with sugar, whipped cream, and other high-calorie additives.  Keep alcohol consumption moderate.

Nutrition experts worry about calcium because they worry about the prospect of developing osteoporosis, the gradual and insidious loss of bone that often comes with old age. In the United States, osteoporosis affects 10 million women and men. Each year it causes more than 2 million fractures, including more than 250,000 broken hips. Breaking a hip in old age can be disabling, even deadly: one-quarter of older people who break a hip die in the following year, often from complications caused by their injuries. Calcium is a key element for building and strengthening bone. But theres little evidence that boosting your calcium intake to the high level that is currently recommended will prevent broken bones. And all the high-profile attention given to calcium is distracting us from strategies that really worklike exercise, getting enough vitamin D and K, avoiding too much vitamin A, and taking certain medications.

Then you can look at milk and dairy foods as an optional part of a healthy diet and take them in moderation, if at all. WHY YOU NEED CALCIUM Your body contains roughly two pounds of calcium, about 99 percent of it locked into bone. Think of that calcium as the mortar that cements and solidifies the components that give bone its substance and strength. The rest of your calcium is dissolved in your blood and the fluid inside and outside cells. That dissolved calcium helps conduct nerve impulses, regulates your heartbeat, and controls other cell functions. Like an obsessive remodeler, your body constantly builds up bone and tears it down. Early in life, building up dominates. Throughout midlife, the two processes generally balance out. Later on, though, demolition may outpace construction and lead to weak or broken bones.

The amount of calcium available to bone-building cells, called osteoblasts, also influences bone remodeling, as do the amounts of vitamins A, D, and K. But as I will describe shortly, exactly how much calcium you need each day is a very open question. HOW MUCH CALCIUM DO WE NEED? We dont really know the healthiest, safest amount of dietary calcium. Different scientific approaches yield different estimates, so its important to consider all the evidence. Daily calcium requirements are traditionally calculated using a balance study. This is a relatively straightforward test: you assemble a group of volunteers, put them on a diet (or give them supplements) containing specific amounts of calcium for a few days or a few weeks, then measure the amount of calcium they excrete in their urine and stool. The balance point is the level at which calcium in equals calcium out. Balance studies show that about 550 milligrams of calcium a day is an optimal level for the mythical average adult. Another route to estimating daily calcium requirements is called the maximal retention study. It, too, usually lasts only a few weeks. Volunteers take different doses of calcium and researchers try to determine the maximum amount of calcium their bodies (mainly their bones) can grab and hold on to.",

Yet another piece of evidence comes from measurements of bone density using special X-ray machines before and after a year or so of calcium supplementation. These studies show an encouraging 1 to 2 percent increase in bone density. If that can be maintained for five or ten years, it would certainly help fortify the skeleton against future damage. But there are problems with these studies. One has to do with the nature of bone itself. The small part of bone that is most able to grow and change, called the remodeling space, contains little calcium. If you greatly increased your calcium intake for a year or sosay, by drinking several glasses of milk a day or taking calcium supplementsthis space would sponge up extra calcium. Your bones calcium content would increase by a small amount, about 1 to 2 percent, but only temporarily. After the first year, the filled-up remodeling space wouldnt hold any more calcium, so continued calcium supplementation or a high-calcium diet would have little further effect on bone density. But it might affect other parts of the body. Whats more, any gains in bone mass would be lost when the higher calcium intake stops.

They make up about 2 million of the 10 million Americans with osteoporosis. Men enter adulthood with stronger, denser bones than women, and they never face the sudden bone-draining loss of estrogen that occurs with menopause. This gives men a fiveto ten-year hedge against osteoporosis, but not lifetime protection. A fundamental problem is that studies lasting just a few weeks or, at most, one or two years observe only what is happening in the remodeling spacenot what is really happening in the big picture of overall bone strength. What these short-term studies fail to capture is the bodys remarkable capacity to adapt. A unique study of Scandinavian prisoners, all men, shows that their bodies were still adapting after several years on a low-calcium diet (500 milligrams a day), mainly by excreting less calcium and using calcium more efficiently. In another study, conducted more than sixty years ago in Peru, prisoners who had been fed diets that gave them less than 500 milligrams of calcium a day for many years had achieved a sustainable calcium balance.",

Heres a long-recognized paradox: rates of hip fracturesthe most serious type of broken bonetend to be high in countries with high dietary calcium intake and low in countries with low calcium consumption (see Figure 19).3 While such country-to-country studies cant prove cause and effect, they do raise questions about the protective effects of high calcium intake.

A meta-analysis of mostly small trials comparing calcium supplements without extra vitamin D to a placebo showed no real effect of extra calcium on overall risk of fractures; in fact, the risk of hip fracture was actually higher among those taking calcium supplements. In the few small trials that suggested a benefit of calcium supplements on fracture risk, the participants were also taking vitamin D, making it impossible to know whether the lower risk of broken bones was due to vitamin D, to calcium, to the combination, or maybe just to chance.

Cells inside bone sense physical strain or stress and orchestrate a silent flurry of activity that remodels the bone to make it more dense and stronger. Among children and young adults, vigorous physical activity lays the foundation for a strong and healthy skeleton. The more activity and healthy stress on bones, the more bone is built. During adulthood, exercise helps maintain the balance between bone-building and bone-dissolving processes. During old age, physical activity limits bone loss. Keep in mind that physical activity doesnt build or strengthen all bones, just those that are stressed. So you need a variety of exercises or activities to keep all your bones healthy. Theres no question that exercise strengthens bones and reduces risk of fractures.",

Not only would that combination continually stimulate bone growth, it would also strengthen muscles and improve balance and so help prevent bone-breaking falls. Hormones. Estrogen and testosterone affect bone health. Estrogen is sometimes called the female hormone and testosterone the male hormone, even though women and men make both of them. Numerous studies have shown that these two hormones are important for building new bone early in life and for keeping it strong over the next seventy years or so. That can be a problem, because production of sex hormones plummets after menopause in women and falls off more gradually in men. In older women, hormone therapyusually estrogen plus a progestin was once the first-line treatment for preventing osteoporosis and heart disease. That ended when the federally funded Womens Health Initiative showed a large increase in breast cancer, an increase in stroke, and transient elevations in heart disease with long-term use of estrogen plus progestin among postmenopausal women.",

In men, the slowdown in sex hormone production isnt as abrupt or as predictable as it is in women.

Its best to get it from food, not supplements. As I describe in chapter eleven, high doses of preformed vitamin A, the kind found in many supplements, stimulate the activity of cells that break down bone. Several studies have shown that intakes of preformed vitamin A above 5,000 international units (IU)the equivalent of 1,500 micrograms increase the chances of losing bone density, the risk of breaking a hip or other bone, or the risk of cancer. Current guidelines recommend that men get 3,000 IU of vitamin A per day and that women get 2,333 IU. Vitamin D. The best-known function of this fat-soluble vitamin is helping the digestive system efficiently absorb calcium and phosphorus. Vitamin D helps build and maintain healthy bones in other ways too. Several studies have shown that vitamin D deficiencies are more common among older people with broken bones than those without them. In the Nurses Health Study, older women who got at least 500 IU of vitamin D a day were one-third less likely to have broken a hip than women who got under 200 IU a day.10 Results from randomized trials of vitamin D and fractures have been mixed, but trials that used 700 IU or more per day showed",

Few foods naturally contain vitamin D, so you need to get most of yours from the sun or supplements. A tablespoon of cod-liver oil delivers more than 1,200 IU of vitamin D. Many multivitamins carry 1,000 IU. Some calcium supplements come with added vitamin D, which is a good idea, since there is actually better evidence for benefits from vitamin D supplements than for calcium. Can extra vitamin D help prevent osteoporosis-related fractures? Although the evidence isnt totally consistent, extra vitamin D may be an effective way to prevent bone loss. I certainly agree with an editorial in the New England Journal of Medicine that succinctly concluded, A widespread increase in vitamin D intake is likely to have a greater effect on osteoporosis and fractures than many other interventions.12 For most people, the easiest way to do this is to take a supplement that contains vitamin D.

Results from the Nurses Health Study show that too little vitamin K may help set the stage for osteoporosis. Women who got slightly more than the current recommended daily intake of vitamin K each day were 30 percent less likely to break a hip than women who got less than that amount.14 The current recommended daily intake for vitamin K is 90 micrograms for women and 120 micrograms for men. Eating one or more servings a day of foods rich in vitamin K should give you enough of this vitamin. If you take warfarin (Coumadin) or another medication to prevent blood clots, talk with your doctor first before boosting your daily intake of vitamin K. PUTTING IT INTO PRACTICE The ideal prevention strategy is one that stops something bad from happening without causing other bad things to happen. Consuming plenty of calcium, mainly from milk and dairy foods, has been portrayed as a key way to prevent osteoporosis and broken bones.

Exactly how much calcium we need for optimal health isnt completely settled. But as I described earlier, a range of 600 to 1,000 milligrams of calcium a day is a good target. Healthy people who exercise, get enough vitamin D, and have a healthy overall diet need less calcium than those on the other end of the spectrum. Heres how to get yourself into a healthy calcium range without meticulously counting milligrams of calcium. First, almost every food you eat contains some calcium (see Calcium in Foods on page 194). Of course, some foods, like greens and whole grains, have more than others. A reasonable diet without milk or other dairy foods can give you about 300 milligrams of calcium a day without thinking about it. Consciously including nondairy high-calcium foods can get you into the target range. (And there are many other added benefits of eating these foods apart from their calcium content.)

Its one reason I dont advise drinking this much milk, along with taking in extra calories. If you dont drink milk or eat other dairy foods, which is fine, and you worry that you arent getting enough calcium from your diet, I suggest taking a daily calcium supplement of 500 milligrams. You dont need more than that. Keep in mind that many foods are now fortified with calcium, including breakfast cereals, orange juice, soy milk, and more. These can easily send your calcium intake above 2,000 milligrams a day. That isnt good: the National Academy of Medicine has set that as the upper limit for anyone over age fifty. In addition, there are four things almost everyone can do to reduce the chances of developing osteoporosis and fractures:  Be as physically active as possible.

CHAPTER ELEVEN Take a Multivitamin for Insurance VITAMINS WERE ONCE THOUGHT OF as nutrients needed in small amounts to prevent diseases with exotic-sounding names like beriberi, pellagra, scurvy, and rickets. Early nutritional guidelines for vitamins focused on the amount needed to avoid these diseases. As they became rarer and rarer during the twentieth century, it seemed that the vast majority of Americans were getting enough vitamins. Getting more than the amounts needed to prevent these so-called deficiency diseases, so the thinking went, was a waste. Or, as a colleague of mine once wrote, vitamin supplements may not do much other than give Americans the richest urine in the world.1 Some innovative thinking and the wonderful, logical conversation of science has been changing the way we think about vitamins, minerals, and other micronutrients. The biggest shift has been the realization that many chronic diseases, such as heart disease and some cancers, could be partly due to nutrient deficiencies, just like beriberi and scurvy. New findings suggest that some people probably many peopledont get enough of these essential micronutrients.

What blew the cover off the old vitamin-deficiency-disease connection was the discovery of a direct link between inadequate intake of the B vitamin folate (also called folic acid) and birth defects such as spina bifida and anencephaly. Both of these, collectively called neural tube defects, happen when the tissues destined to become the spinal cord, the bony tube that protects it, and the brain dont develop as they should during the first twenty-eight days of pregnancy. Spina bifida can cause paralysis and other disabilities. Children with anencephaly are born without most of the brain and spinal cord; they are either stillborn or survive for only a short time after birth. Worldwide, about 300,000 babies are born with neural tube defects each year. Neural tube defects were most common in poor populations with poor diets. That connection prompted a search for nutritional causes. In 1976, a British team found that mothers of children with neural tube defects had relatively low levels of micronutrients.2 Other teams discovered that drugs that interfered with folic acid also increased the risk of having a child with a neural tube defect. The notuncommon scientific seesaw followed: some studies implicated low folic acid in these birth defects, others didnt; some small trials showed a benefit for folic acid supplem",

At first, the recommendations on folic acid were cautious. Initial guidelines from the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) in 1991 were aimed only at women who had already had a child with a neural tube defect. A year later the CDC broadened its message, recommending that all women who could become pregnant get 400 micrograms of folic acid a daymore than double what had been recommended before. Because many women were not heeding this advice, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration took the extraordinary step of requiring that folic acid be added to most enriched breads, flours, corn meals, pastas, rice, and other grain products along with the iron and other B vitamins that have been added for years. This has boosted the average intake of folic acid by about 100 micrograms per day.

As described later, low folic acid has been implicated in both of these. This chapter doesnt exhaustively review all vitamins and minerals. Instead it touches on those with newly recognized or suspected roles beyond the classic deficiency diseases. Along the way, it points out how to get more vitamins and minerals in your diet and which ones you might want to, or need to, get from a supplement. The table on pages 237239 lists the current recommended daily intake of vitamins and minerals. WHAT ARE VITAMINS? The classic definition of vitamin is this: a carbon-containing compound essential in small quantities for normal functioning of the body. In plainer English, vitamins are a type of nutrient your body cant make but must get from food. Vitamins are usually classified as either fat soluble or water soluble. Fat-soluble vitamins like vitamin A tend to accumulate in the body, while water-soluble vitamins like vitamin C dont. VITAMIN A Virtually every high school biology course covers the role that vitamin A plays in vision.

Vitamin A also helps regulate the processes by which cells split and specialize. This suggests that the body uses vitamin A to keep normal cells from turning into cancer cells and keeps cells that do become cancerous from dividing and spreading. There are two main sources of vitamin A. Preformed vitamin A, also known as retinol, is found mainly in liver, fish oils, meat, eggs, and some vitamin supplements. The other source is fruits and vegetables rich in alpha-carotene, betacarotene, and other so-called provitamins that your body turns into vitamin A. Preliminary studies suggest that getting too little vitamin A may lead to a modest increase in cancer risk. They also show that once you reach a certain threshold level of vitamin A in your system, theres no benefit in getting more. That threshold appears to be in the range of the current recommended daily intakes (see Recommended Intake below). As I mentioned earlier (see page 202), getting too much preformed vitamin A may harm your bones.

In high amounts, vitamin A can block the effects of vitamin D, which is good for bones and muscles and has a calming effect on cancer cells. It is easy to get too much vitamin A from supplements. I recommend avoiding vitamin A supplements unless you have a specific medical reason for them. When shopping for a multivitamin, look for one that gets all or most of its vitamin A activity from beta-carotene. Try to keep your intake of preformed vitamin A (retinol) from supplements under 2,000 IU a day. Recommended intake: 3,000 IU for men (900 micrograms of retinol equivalents) and 2,333 IU for women (700 micrograms for retinol equivalents).

Not getting enough B6 can also increase blood levels of homocysteine, an amino acid, which may increase the risk of heart disease (see Homocysteine and the Heart on page 213).

(The form of B12 in fortified food or multiple vitamins can be absorbed even when B12 from food is not.) By age fifty, most of us have accumulated enough B12 and stored it in the liver to keep us going for years, even if our capacity to extract it from food declines. People with inflammatory bowel disease or AIDS can have problems absorbing vitamin B12 from food. Drinking too much alcohol can interfere with this vitamin.

A meta-analysis of thirty randomized controlled trials that included 82,000 participants showed that getting extra folic acid from supplements decreased the risk of stroke by 10 percent and the risk of any kind of cardiovascular disease by 4 percent. The benefit was biggest among participants with low folate levels to start.9 Folates key role in building DNA means that it plays a role in cell division and so may help prevent cancer as well. Getting enough folic acid seems to decrease the risk of developing colon cancer and possibly breast cancer. One of the interesting findings we have seen in the Nurses Health Studyand that other researchers have seen in other populationsis that folic acid may temper the increase in breast cancer seen in women who average more than one alcoholic drink a day.10 The same is true for colon cancer, another disease that is more common among alcohol drinkers than nondrinkers.

Most breakfast cereals are now fortified with folic acid and contain 100 micrograms per serving; some contain as much as 400 micrograms, a full days requirement. Green leafy vegetables are an excellent source of folate, with beans, lentils, chickpeas, and black beans delivering 20 to 50 micrograms per serving.

CAROTENOIDS: BETA-CAROTENE, LYCOPENE, AND MORE Plants make hundreds of different pigments. Some trap sunlight and transform it into chemical energy; others prevent the suns rays from damaging the plant. Some pigments advertise ripeness to the animals that will disperse the plants seeds; others warn hungry critters that the plant contains nasty or poisonous chemicals. One large group of plant pigments is the carotenoid family. You probably know a number of carotenoids by sight if not by name. Beta-carotene is the pigment that gives carrots and sweet potatoes their characteristic orange hues. Lycopene is responsible for the tempting red of a juicy tomato or the cool pink of watermelon flesh. Other well-studied carotenoids include lutein and zeaxanthin (the only carotenoids found in the eyes retina), alpha-carotene, and beta-cryptoxanthin. These six are just a drop in the bucket of the five hundred or so known carotenoids. Beta-carotene and alpha-carotene are vitamins, both forms of vitamin A; most others are not considered vitamins.

Dozens of observational studies show that people who choose to eat more fruits and vegetables high in carotenoids have less cardiovascular disease; cancers of the prostate, lung, stomach, colon, breast, cervix, and pancreas; memory loss; multiple sclerosis; and cataract formation and macular degeneration. Unfortunately, randomized trials in which volunteers have consumed specific antioxidants have not (so far) shown much reduction in risk of developing cancer or cardiovascular disease.

VITAMIN C Do you reach for an orange, a glass of orange juice, or a vitamin C tablet at the first sign of a cold? If so, you arent alone. Its an impulse nudged by Vitamin C and the Common Cold, written in 1970 by Linus Pauling, a double Nobel laureate and selfproclaimed champion of vitamin C. Pauling fervently believed that megadoses of vitamin Cbetween 1,000 and 2,000 milligrams a day (the amount in twelve to twenty-four oranges!) could prevent and abort colds . . . and could do the same for cancer. Theres no question that vitamin C plays a role in fighting infection. It helps make collagen, a substance you need for healthy bones, ligaments, teeth, gums, and blood vessels. It helps make several hormones and chemical messengers used in the brain and nerves. It is also a potent antioxidant that can neutralize the tissuedamaging free radicals that assail the body.

Not the common cold: study after study has failed to prove Paulings proposition.13 Theres a smattering of evidence that a little extra vitamin C, about the amount found in a typical multivitamin, at the very beginning of a cold might relieve some symptoms, but theres no support for megadoses. Prevent cancer and heart disease? The evidence is thin and most studies dont support that. Its possible that some extra vitamin C might help prevent cataract formation, but here again more research is needed. Recommended intake: The current recommended dietary allowance for vitamin C is 75 milligrams a day for women and 90 milligrams a day for men, with an extra 35 milligrams a day for smokers. As the evidence continues to unfold, I suggest getting 200 to 300 milligrams of vitamin C a day. This is easy to do with a good diet and a standard multivitamin pill. Good food sources: Good food sources of vitamin C are citrus fruits and juices, berries, green and red peppers, tomatoes, broccoli, and spinach.

VITAMIN D We are only now beginning to understand the widespread importance of vitamin D. Once known solely for its ability to help the body absorb and hold on to calcium and phosphorous, vitamin D is turning out to be far more versatile and important. Vitamin D isnt exactly a vitamin. Instead it is a hormone made by a rather unusual gland: your skin. Sunlight striking the skin turns a cousin of cholesterol into previtamin D. This is first processed by the liver and then activated by the kidneys or by cells in the heart, immune system, breast, or prostate. Although calcium usually gets all the credit for building bones and preventing fractures, vitamin D should get equal billing. It helps on several levels. Vitamin D ensures that calcium and phosphorus (another integral part of bone) are absorbed as they pass through the digestive system.",

A growing body of research suggests that many Americans could reduce bone loss by getting extra vitamin D. In fact, doing this more effectively reduces hip and wrist fractures in older women and men than does dramatically increasing calcium consumption. There are other reasons to get more vitamin D besides strong bones. Here are a few of them: fewer falls, probably less cancer, as well as the possibilities of better blood pressure, a stronger heart, fewer serious infections, reduced likelihood of asthma, and protection against multiple sclerosis.  Stronger muscles and fewer falls. Vitamin D signals muscle cells to make new protein. This may strengthen muscle and improve stability, especially in older people. A pooled analysis of ten randomized trials of vitamin D supplementation (200 to 1,000 IU) showed that it resulted in 14 percent fewer falls than calcium alone or a placebo.14 However, too much vitamin D may tip the balance in the other direction.

This means vitamin D can stifle new cancer cells much like a blanket on a small fire, snuffing out their progression to life-threatening tumors. The evidence is particularly strong for colorectal cancer. With remarkable consistency, men and women with higher blood levels of vitamin D have lower future risks of this serious cancer.16  Heart disease.

People who can bask in strong sunlight for a few minutes on most days yearround make plenty of vitamin D.

In a national survey of Americans, black men and women had about half the vitamin D in their blood as their white counterparts. The gradual loss of skin pigmentation as humans migrated northward from the so-called cradle of mankind in Africa was probably an evolutionary adaptation to capture more vitamin D from less sunlight. Yet even the near-complete loss of melanin in the skin in very fair Scandinavians isnt enough to compensate for the lack of strong sunlight, and thus many have low levels of vitamin D. Northern populations have compensated for this by eating plenty of fatty fish, including the vitamin Drich livers, or taking cod-liver oil.

Instead, its best to take a vitamin D supplement to make sure you have enough on board. Good food sources: Very few foods naturally contain vitamin D. Cold-water fish such as mackerel, salmon, sardines, and bluefish contain good doses of this fatsoluble vitamin; their livers contain very high levels.

This was most likely due to the calcium, as the amount of vitamin D in the supplement was low.22 VITAMIN E The vitamin E story is much like the one for beta-carotene: early curiosity, intriguing laboratory results, and promising observational studies that documented a relationship between vitamin E and decreased risk of heart disease followed by disappointing clinical trials in which large groups of volunteersmostly people already diagnosed with heart diseasewere randomized to take either vitamin E or placebo pills. There are some important differences between the two stories, though. Most people get between 5 and 15 IU of vitamin E a day. Yet it takes several hundred IU a day to significantly block the oxidation of LDL cholesterol, and the biggest inhibition happens at about 800 IU a day. Vitamin E supplements have been tested against heart disease in randomized trials such as the Cambridge Heart Antioxidant Study (CHAOS), the Gruppo Italiano per lo Studio della Sopravvivenza nellInfarto Miocardio (known as the GISSI Prevention Trial), and the Heart Outcomes Prevention Evaluation (HOPE). Early results suggested a cardiovascular benefit of taking vitamin E supplements, but most of the later larger studies did not.

But it also helps reduce the tendency for clots to form in the bloodstream; such clots can trigger a heart attack or stroke. In the Womens Health Study trial, women taking vitamin E were less likely to have developed serious clots in the legs and lungs, especially those who unknowingly had a genetic predisposition to clot formation.30 Its hard to say why the results from randomized trials and those from observational studies dont square. There are multiple potential explanations and they will be grist for future research. With the information we have in hand right now, dont rely on high doses of vitamin E to protect you against a heart attack, stroke, or cancer. Another possible benefit of vitamin E is protection against age-related dementia. Some early studies suggested that people who took vitamin E supplements were less likely to develop this common and troubling condition, but those findings havent held up in further studies.31 Another possibly promising line of research involves vitamin E and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (also known as Lou Gehrigs disease).",

On a list of the biggest nutritional buzzwords from the last couple of decades, antioxidant would be near the top. Before 1990 this pack of electron-donating compounds was of interest mostly to chemists and food researchers. Today antioxidants are touted in books with titles like The Antioxidant Miracle and Antioxidant Smoothies. They are promoted in herbal pharmacies and mainstream magazines as wonder substances that can prevent cancer, heart disease, memory loss, and cataracts and even reverse the aging process. The term antioxidant refers to these nutrients: vitamin C, vitamin E, beta-carotene and other related carotenoids, the minerals selenium and manganese, glutathione, coenzyme Q10, lipoic acid, flavonoids, phenols, polyphenols, phytoestrogens, and more.

Free radicals are present in the air you breathe, the food you eat, and the water you drink. They are plentiful in cigarette smoke, yours or someone elses. Sunlight hitting your skin or beaming into your eye also generates free radicals. Free radicals are born missing one or more electrons, so they scavenge them from nearby DNA, important structural or functional proteins, LDL cholesterol particles, and even cell membranes. This can subtly alter the function of these substances or cell parts, or outright damage them. Over time, this damage adds up: free radicals are thought to play roles in cancer, heart disease, arthritis, cataract formation, memory loss, and aging, to name just a few health issues. Bruce Ames, a noted molecular biologist at the University of California, Berkeley, has estimated that the genetic material in each cell of the human body gets about 10,000 oxidative hits a day.24 Multiply this by the several trillion cells in your body and factor in the other cellular components that can be damaged by free radicals and oxidizing agents, and you get an idea of the magnitude of the attack.

Taking high-dose betacarotene or vitamin E pills is like listening to a single violin play a Mozart symphony: you get a little something but not the full, glorious effect. Its also possible that the imbalance that occurs by taking too much of any one antioxidant may be like listening to an orchestra in which one section is playing at eardrum-shattering volume. While some initial studies were generally bullish on the benefits of antioxidants against heart disease and cancer, little or no benefit has been seen in most large, randomized controlled trials of high-dose antioxidant supplements, and harm was seen in some trials. James Watson, who won a Nobel Prize for helping work out the structure of DNA, has even suggested that taking in loads of antioxidants from supplements may actually contribute to cancer. Free radicals help kill cancer cells. Taking an excess of antioxidants from supplements, he argues, destroys this natural anticancer activity and may prevent cancer drugs from destroying cancer cells.25 Two bright spots for antioxidant vitamin supplements are for eye health and brain health.

At least 1 million cataract extraction operations are done in the United States each year, at a cost of more than 3 billion. In the six-year Age-Related Eye Disease Study (AREDS), a combination of vitamin C, vitamin E, beta-carotene, and zinc offered some protection against the development of advanced age-related macular degeneration, but not cataracts, in people who were at high risk of the disease.26 Lutein, a naturally occurring carotenoid found in green, leafy vegetables such as spinach and kale, and other phytonutrients may also protect vision. A new trial of the AREDS supplement regimen added lutein and the closely related carotenoid zeaxanthin.27 Overall, lutein and zeaxanthin modestly reduced risk of advanced macular degeneration, but a large reduction in risk was seen among those who had low blood levels of lutein and zeaxanthin at the beginning of the study.

Safety: One meta-analysis of vitamin E trials showed that the use of high-dose vitamin E (more than 400 IU a day) might slightly increase death rates.33 Headlines screamed, Vitamin E Death Risk, but I dont believe this is so. Most of the trials in the analysis included only volunteers with heart disease. An exhaustive review of vitamin E by the Institute of Medicine concluded that vitamin E is safe up to doses of 1,000 milligrams a day (1,500 IU of natural-source vitamin E).34 The only documented harmful effect of too much vitamin E is the worsening of a rare eye problem known as retinitis pigmentosa. One thing to be aware of: If you take a blood thinner, talk with your health care providers before starting to take a vitamin E supplement, since it can reduce the bloods ability to clot.

According to conventional wisdom, most adults get enough vitamin K because it is found in so many foods, especially green leafy vegetables and commonly used cooking oils. That wasnt entirely backed up by a survey of vitamin K in the American diet, which showed average intakes hovering slightly under the recommended daily intake.35 It also revealed that a fair number of Americans, particularly young ones, arent getting the vitamin K that they need, mainly because they dont eat enough green leafy vegetables. Recommended intake: The recommended dietary allowance for vitamin K is 90 micrograms a day for adult women and 120 micrograms a day for adult men.

If you feel that you arent getting enough calcium in your diet and want to get more, try a calcium supplement. They contain no calories and no saturated fat and are far cheaper than several daily servings of dairy products. Chewable calcium-based antacids such as Tums are a cheap and efficient way to get calcium. A calcium supplement that also includes vitamin D is even better. Safety: A high level of calcium in the blood (hypercalcemia) can cause problems ranging from kidney stones to hardening of the arteries. Although this can happen as a result of very high calcium intake, it is usually caused by overactivity of the parathyroid glands or cancer. Consuming too much calcium can cause constipation and may interfere with the absorption of iron and zinc. As I describe in chapter ten, current evidence links higher intake of calcium from supplements with increased risk of kidney stones and prostate cancer. Calcium from foods, though, may reduce the risk of kidney stones by binding oxalate, a compound found in rhubarb, beets, spinach, nuts, tea, and a variety of chocolate and soy products, that has been linked to the formation of kidney stones.

Lack of iron stunts the growth and development of children and can damage long-term thinking skills. Iron deficiency isnt a major problem in the United States. But it is elsewhere: half of the earths inhabitants dont get enough iron. Most Americans get plenty of iron from eating meat and iron-fortified grain and other products. However, infants and women in their childbearing years often dont get enough iron. Thats why infant formulas contain extra iron, why pregnant women are encouraged to take a multivitamin supplement with extra iron, and why women are urged to get enough iron from their diets or from supplements while they are menstruating. There are two types of iron in food. Heme iron, which travels around the bloodstream in the oxygen-carrying protein hemoglobin, comes from red meat, poultry, and fish. Non-heme iron comes from fruits, vegetables, grains, nuts, and other plants. The body absorbs heme iron more easily than it absorbs non-heme iron, even when we already have enough iron aboard. People who need extra iron are often advised to eat lean red meat. Meat is certainly a great source of this mineral, but it is also high in calories, saturated fat, and cholesterol.

That could be a problem if, as some research has shown, iron acts as a powerful generator of free radicals. A controversial iron hypothesis for heart disease was first floated in 1981. It suggested that the more iron you store, the higher your risk of heart disease. However, the evidence supporting this idea was weak to begin with and has gotten weaker with further studies. A similar hypothesis has been raised for cancer, and the jury is still out on that too.

Other studies dont show a link between low magnesium and these chronic conditions.

Although the best way to ensure an adequate potassium intake is by eating lots of fruits and vegetables. Potassium salt substitutes can be helpful to people with hypertension, those who take diuretics, and heavy coffee drinkers. Dont take potassium supplements unless you have discussed this with your physician, because they can be deadly when the kidneys arent working properly. Recommended intake: The recommended dietary allowance for potassium is 4,700 milligrams a day for adults. Good food sources: Bananas are famous for the amount of potassium they contain. But many other fruits and vegetables are also good sources. These include apricots, dates, kidney beans, oranges, spinach, nuts, seeds, and whole grains (see the table on page 228). Safety: The Food and Nutrition Board of the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine hasnt set an upper limit for potassium.

Sodium is an essential part of our diet, but most Americans get more than they need. Its hard not to. Prepared foods are often loaded with table salt, which is one-third sodium. A cup of boxed macaroni and cheese or an order of Burger King salted french fries can deliver more than 1,000 milligrams of sodiummost of a days healthy ration. Its also often found where you least expect it: a cup of pasta sauce can have almost half of a days healthy salt allotment (see Hidden Salt in Food on page 230). Although the daily value for sodium listed on food labels is 2,300 milligrams, the average person actually needs less than 1,000 milligrams a day to keep his or her systems in good working order. Thats less than half a teaspoon of salt. Yet the average American gets more than three times that amount, about 3,500 milligrams of sodium. The excess is excreted, but not always before it can do some damage. Excess sodium pulls water from cells and thus increases blood pressure, especially in people whose genes make them more sensitive to salt.

Whether reducing sodium reduces the risk of cardiovascular disease has been controversial, but the overall evidence strongly supports a benefit of limiting sodium intake, even though the optimal target is not clear. Cutting back on sodium is often one of the first things that health care providers suggest to people who have just been diagnosed with high blood pressure, along with stopping smoking and getting more exercise. For years, the results of salt reduction studies were inconsistent and controversial. But the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) II study, which carefully controlled the amount of salt in participants diets, showed that aggressively cutting back on salt had an important effect on blood pressure.36 This has been supported by other carefully controlled studies. As described in chapter eight, the first DASH trial also clearly showed that eating more fruits and vegetables can substantially lower blood pressure. Documenting the best sodium intake has been difficult. One reason is that its hard to measure how much sodium individuals consume because this mineral is hidden in so many processed foods. In addition, long-term trials of sodium intake are difficult to do because keeping people on low-sodium diets is difficult in an era when high-sodium and hidden-sodium foods are everywhere.",

The most effective way to keep blood pressure low combines weight loss (if needed), eating plenty of fruits and vegetables rich in potassium, and staying away from foods high in salt. The bottom line is that a salty diet doesnt do you any good and can be harmful, so cutting out unnecessary salt makes sense. Recommended intake: The National Academy of Medicine and the 20152020 Dietary Guidelines for Americans recommend getting no more than 2,300 milligrams of sodium a day. The American Heart Association, meanwhile, recommends getting no more than 1,500 milligrams a day. The rationale for a lower target is that further decreasing sodium intake to that level helps further reduce blood pressure, which is a strong risk factor for cardiovascular disease. Good food sources: Sodium isnt the kind of nutrient you need to look forit finds you. Rather than searching for foods that are good sources of sodium, most people need to seek low-sodium foods. Almost any unprocessed foodvegetables, fruits, grains, nuts, meats, dairy foods and the likeare low in sodium. Safety: The Food and Nutrition Board set 2,300 milligrams of sodium a day as its upper limit. More than that isnt immediately harmful but can nudge you toward developing high blood pressure, which over a lifetime affects 90 of Americans.

In the 1980s, selenium was added to fertilizer in Finland, where the soil leveland thus intakewere low. Although blood levels of selenium rose dramatically, cancer rates didnt budge. The Nutritional Prevention of Cancer study showed that taking extra selenium, 200 micrograms a day, may have offered some protection against skin cancer.37 However, the Selenium and Vitamin E Cancer Prevention Trial (SELECT), established to look at prostate cancer, did not support the finding on skin cancer. It failed to answer the question about selenium and prostate cancer because only one case of fatal prostate cancer occurred during the trial.38 In some regions of China and other parts of the world with very low soil levels of selenium, low intakes of this mineral has led to a unique form of heart disease.

Safety: Selenium is toxic at high doses, with a tolerable upper intake of 400 micrograms a day for adults. As with other micronutrients, its hard to take in that much selenium from food. Getting too much from supplements can cause brittle hair and nails, upset stomach, skin rash, bad breath, and extreme exhaustion. Some types of Brazil nuts deliver a lot of selenium because of the high levels in the soil where they are produced. If you frequently consume them, try to eat a variety of nuts instead so you dont get too much selenium. ZINC You may have seen the cold-fighting zinc lozenges near the checkout counter of your local pharmacy or grocery store. These lozenges have been the topic of many trials to determine whether they truly shorten the duration of colds. More than a dozen studies have been conducted among people just developing colds, some of whom took zinc and some of whom didnt. The results have been inconsistent. However, in two recent meta-analyses, cold sufferers who popped the unpleasanttasting zinc lozenges reduced their symptoms by about one to two days on average compared with those taking placebo lozenges.39 Theres no question that zinc plays a key role in keeping the immune system healthy.",

No. Despite the fact that most Americans actually get less than the recommended daily amount of zinc, theres little evidence that such low intakes cause health problems. Studies looking at colon cancer, prostate cancer, prostate inflammation (prostatitis), and macular degeneration have not shown a clear link with zinc intake. Some people need extra zinc. Children need enough of this mineral for growth and development. Too little zinc may be one of the ways that undernourishment slows brain development and motor skills, contributes to hyperactivity, and causes problems with attention. Older people may need extra zinc for several reasons. They tend to consume less zinc than younger people. They often have trouble absorbing zinc from food. The medications they take, especially diuretics for high blood pressure, can increase zinc excretion. And the extra fiber and calcium they may take can bind zinc and make it unavailable to the digestive system. Heavy drinkers, people with digestive problems such as Crohns disease and ulcerative colitis, and those with chronic infections also need extra zinc.",

Poultry, crab and lobster, beans, nuts, whole grains, fortified breakfast cereals, and dairy foods such as milk and yogurt are also good sources.

A years supply costs under 40, or about a dime a day. Thats an excellent nutritional bang for your buck. I use the term insurance for good reason. A multivitamin cant in any way replace healthy eating. It gives you barely a scintilla of the vast array of healthful nutrients found in food. It doesnt deliver any fiber. Or taste. Or enjoyment. The only thing it can do is offer a nutritional backup or fill in the nutrient holes that can plague even the most conscientious eaters. For example, eating more fruits and vegetables is great, but it wont give you much in the way of vitamin D. Adding more whole grains to your diet is also wonderful, but it wont net you much vitamin B6. Older people and those with digestive problems may not be able to absorb enough vitamin B12 from food. Those who regularly drink alcohol may need extra folic acid to make up for alcohols folate-reducing effects.

Extra vitamin D is definitely worth pursuing. Standard multivitamins offer 400 to 600 IU, half of what appears to be needed for optimal health. Some companies make supplements that replace most of the preformed vitamin A with beta-carotene and contain adequate doses of vitamin D. I recommend looking for one of these, because it is too easy to get too much preformed vitamin A. One example is the Basic One multivitamin formulated by Dr. Kenneth Cooper, founder of the Cooper Clinic in Dallas. It contains plenty of vitamin A (2,000 IU), all in the form of beta-carotene, along with 2,000 IU of vitamin D and 200 IU of vitamin E. Menstruating women should get the version that includes iron, which men and postmenopausal women dont need. So far theres no consensus on ideal vitamin intakes because scientific knowledge about them is still evolving. We could definitely use more evidence about the true benefits of the commonly used vitamins. At the same time, harm isnt likely when they are taken in reasonable doses, and the cost is minimal.

The results were promising. The researchers recruited more than 14,000 older male physicians. Half took Centrum Silver for up to fourteen years, while the other half took an identical-looking placebo. At the end of the trial, there was an 8 percent reduction in the risk of developing any type of cancer in the multivitamin group compared to the placebo group.40 Much of this was due to a reduction in risk of colorectal cancer as predicted by previous prospective cohort studies. The multivitamin-multimineral supplement didnt appear to help prevent cardiovascular disease or protect memory or thinking skills.41 Two things about this trial make it noteworthy: It would never have uncovered a connection between multivitamin use and cancer, especially colorectal cancer, if the study hadnt lasted longer than ten years, which is longer than most vitamin trials.

CHAPTER TWELVE The Planets Health Matters Too WHAT YOU AND I EAT unquestionably affects our individual health. What we eat collectively affects the health of our planet and thus the health of our children, grandchildren, and future generations. In the first edition of this book, published sixteen years ago, climate change was becoming a global concern. I included a few paragraphs on the effects of different dietary choices on the production of greenhouse gases and other environmental impacts. What we have experienced and learned since then has made climate change a major and urgent issue.

When I first worked in Tanzania as a medical student in the 1960s, the top of Mount Kilimanjaro was covered in snow year-round. Today, that snow has almost disappeared and will soon be gone. Icebergs are retreating and vanishing around the world. The Arctic Ocean is becoming open for shipping on an annual basis. Deadly storms, droughts, floods, and other extreme weather events are occurring with increasing regularity. Why mention this in a book on healthy eating? Climate directly affects food production, and food production can affect climate and the environment. THREE KEY ISSUES Growing your own food in a hand-tended garden has minimal effect on the environment, especially if you use just the right amount of natural fertilizer, rely on natural strategies to control weeds and pests, and grow only as much as you need. But few of us are able to get most of the food we need this way. Understanding how food is produced, and then making small changes in the food you buy and eat, can help lighten your carbon footprint on the planet. Farming and food production can harm the environment in many ways. Here are four of the most important: Climate change.

Burning fossil fuels generates carbon dioxide, the main greenhouse gas responsible for trapping heat in the atmosphere. On top of this, cattle, sheep, and other ruminant animals grown for food generate and release methane as part of their natural digestive process. This gas is twenty-five times more powerful than carbon dioxide at trapping heat. Feeding grain that has been produced by industrial farming to cattle, which convert it to meat or milk, is far less energy efficient and produces more greenhouse gases than eating that grain directly. In an American feedlot, it takes between 15 and 20 pounds of grain to produce 1 pound of beef. Although the numbers vary depending on how emissions are calculated, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency estimated that, in 2015, agriculture was responsible for 7.9 to 9 percent of the country's emissions of carbon dioxide and methane, the two leading greenhouse gases.1 Between 80 and 90 percent of this is the result of food production; the rest comes from packaging, refrigeration, and transportation.

American agriculture also creates water pollution. Fertilizer, herbicides, and pesticides run off farmland into rivers and lakes and eventually make their way into the oceans. Manure from animal feedlots and from fish farming does the same thing. The influx of nutrients often causes huge blooms of algae. These can produce toxins that can harm other aquatic organisms, livestock, pets, and even humans. Decomposition of dying and dead algae can use up most or all of the oxygen in the water, which kills fish and other aquatic animals. The Gulf of Mexico is just one example of this. As the Mississippi River flows from Minnesota to Louisiana, it picks up nutrient-rich runoff from much of the United States agriculture belt and deposits it in the Gulf. In the summer of 2016, the algae bloom and subsequent die-off created a dead zone along the continental shelf along the coasts of Louisiana and east Texas that was nearly 7,000 square miles, or about the size of the state of Connecticut. In some regions of the world, water is pulled from aquifers (underground layers of rock that hold water) to irrigate crops faster than it is replaced by rain and runoff.

In addition, it is also turning diverse landscapes into monocultures. When visiting a meadow near our summer cabin in New Hampshire, my wife, Gail, and I could always be sure we could show our children countless monarch butterfliesuntil a few years ago. Despite plenty of milkweed, the favored food of these beautiful creatures, their numbers have dwindled: two years ago we found just three or four monarchs and last year saw none. Flying from the East Coast to the West on a clear day provides a picture of the problem: vast fields of crops without the natural habitat needed for monarchs to complete their yearly migration. I also see this when visiting the Willett family farm in Michigan: what were once small fields and hedgerows teeming with diverse life are now massive monocultures of corn and soy. Monarchs are just one highly visible species in this vulnerable situationand they still can be saved.

Thats a tall order, especially when 1 billion people around the globe dont get enough food to eat and the diets of billions more in developed countries dont meet national dietary guidelines.

One step will be limiting consumption of red meat, poultry, fish, and other food from animals, which generates far more greenhouse gases than does eating food from plants. Another step is limiting the use of fossil fuels in the production of food. Emphasizing local production of seasonal fruits and vegetables will also play a role.

Our daily personal food choices collectively have important effects on the environment. These personal changes are the focus of this chapter. Fortunately, choices that benefit planetary health are well aligned with individual health and well-being. Eat Less Red Meat and Dairy Foods The single most important step you can take to limit your carbon footprint is to eat less red meat and dairy foods. Feeding grain to cattle to make steaks and hamburgers instead of just eating that grain wastes a lot of energy. That inefficiency is less important when cattle graze on plants growing all by themselves on land that isnt usable for much else, although these cattle still produce methane every hour of every day they are alive.

While beef represents just 4 percent of the United States retail food supply, it accounts for 36 percent of all diet-related greenhouse gas emissions.7 Making a pound of lamb generates five times more greenhouse gases than making a pound of chicken and thirty times more than making a pound of lentils.8 One very persuasive number is the total environmental cost of producing protein. The Union of Concerned Scientists has calculated that one pound of beef creates seventeen times more water pollution and twenty times more habitat alteration than 1 pound of pasta.9 DIETARY GUIDELINES DROP THE BALL AGAIN The scientific panel chosen to advise the federal government for the 20152020 update of the Dietary Guidelines for Americans recommended that Americans should eat diets that require fewer resources to produceand specifically recommended eating less red meat for both human and planetary health, exactly what I recommend in this book.10 That statement was immediately criticized by the North American Meat Institute and other organizations, which claimed that the advisor",

This not only censored the Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee, it prevented Americans from getting the best possible dietary advice. With their hands tied by the language in the appropriations bill, the heads of the USDA and the Department of Health and Human Services, the two agencies that create the final Dietary Guidelines, announced that we do not believe that the 2015 DGAs are the appropriate vehicle for this important policy conversation about sustainability.11 Sadly, they offered no alternative vehicle for this essential discussion.

Some argue that consuming grass-fed beef instead of feedlot beef is one way to reduce the environmental impact of eating beef. It isnt that simple (see Grass-Fed Beef or Regular? on page 248). If we collectively stopped feeding grain to beef cattle, the result would be far lower beef production, much less land use for grain production, less water use and contamination, and less antibiotic resistance. Thats a multiple win solution. I cover the direct health effects of grass-fed versus grain-fed beef in chapter seven.

Dairy foods also have a large environmental footprint, though not as much as beef. Pork has less, and poultry even less, but not quite as low as most vegetable sources of protein such as soybeans or lentils. Fish, shrimp, and oysters can be extremely efficient converters of feed to flesh, in part because they are cold-blooded and dont need to burn calories to stay warm. Like other forms of agriculture, aquaculture can be done carefully, with minimal impact on the environment, or it can be done poorly, using industrially farmed grain, releasing highly polluting fish waste into the environment, and using large amounts of antibiotics.

However, there are many exceptions. How your diet affects the environment is usually determined more by the foods you choose (for example, beef versus chicken or soy) than the effects of processing and transportation. For example, per unit of food, greenhouse gas emissions may be less for transporting carloads of fruit from Florida to Boston by train than moving a small amount by pickup truck from the western part of the state to a farmers market.

But the amounts of omega-3 fats in beef are smallespecially compared to those in fish and they come with a large amount of saturated fat, cholesterol, and other nutrients that contribute to higher risk of heart disease. In addition, its still unknown if the fats in beef are fully responsible for the increased risks of diabetes and heart disease linked to eating red meat. My bottom line is that grass-fed beef is probably not importantly different for your personal health than feedlot beef. And although the concept of grass-fed beef sounds more environmentally friendly, especially with regard to greenhouse gas production, it really isnt. The environmental impact of feeding a cow or bull grain on a daily basis is definitely larger for feedlot beef than grass-fed beef. But it takes only about two years for a feedlot cow to come to market, compared to about four years for a grass-fed cow.

Stopping this practice is one of the most important steps we can take to reduce those environmental impacts of our diets. This will also likely reduce problems of antibiotic resistance (see page 142), because huge amounts are used to deal with the unsanitary conditions and crowding in feedlots. Eating less beef and other red meat and more poultry, fish, and plant sources of protein would lead to healthier people and a healthier planet.

CHAPTER THIRTEEN Putting It All Together AS I HAVE LAID OUT in the preceding chapters, much of the nutrition advice we commonly hear is steering us in the wrong direction. The low-fat, highcarbohydrate approach promoted for years has been a national disaster. The highfat, low-carb approach once known as the Atkins diet correctly identified high consumption of refined carbohydrates as a problem, but loading up with red meat and dairy fat is far from healthy.",

Todays gluten-free fad isnt based on evidence and has led many people to eat in unhealthy ways. The road to good health isnt one of blandness and deprivation. Instead its paved with hearty, tasty, and satisfying foods. The Healthy Eating Pyramid and Healthy Eating Plate, both built with the best available nutrition science as a blueprint, can guide you to better health and a satisfying diet. They recommend:  maintaining a stable, healthy weight  eating plenty of vegetables and fruits  consuming more unsaturated fats, less saturated fat, and no trans fat  eating whole grains and foods made from them in place of refined grains  choosing healthier sources of protein by trading red meat for nuts, beans, chicken, and fish  drinking water, tea, or coffee instead of juice or sugar-sweetened soda and, if you drink alcohol, keeping it moderate (no more than two drinks a day for men or one a day for women)  taking a daily multivitamin for insurance. At first glance, it might look like I am promoting a traditional Mediterranean diet. While the Mediterranean diet fits this description, and is an excellent place to start, what I suggest isnt limited to the culinary experience of just one place or time.

BENEFITS OF THIS EATING STRATEGY Part of the payoff from following this healthy eating strategy comes immediately. By opening up a new world of foods, flavors, and textures, it will make eating a pleasure. It can help you break out of the often unsatisfying and not-so-healthy mealtime ruts you can fall into when following a low-fat or low-carb diet. As you gain control of your appetite and eating habits, not to mention your weight, cholesterol levels, and maybe even your blood pressure, youll gain a sense of achievement and pride that may affect other areas of your life. Youll also have more energy and feel better right now as well as years down the road. The other part of the payoffprotection against chronic diseasecomes later. A healthful eating strategy like the one I suggest can help protect you from developing a long list of common diseases. These include heart disease, stroke, type 2 diabetes, several common cancers, cataracts, osteoporosis, dementia, and other age-related diseases. It also helps prevent some types of birth defects.

THE HARVARD HEALTHY EATING PLATE Figure 22. The Harvard Healthy Eating Plate was created to address deficiencies in the USDAs MyPlate. It provides simple but detailed guidance to help people make the best eating choices. THE ROMANCE AND REALITY OF TRADITIONAL DIETS The term traditional diet once meant a plain, none-too-varied regional diet that was the standard fare of farmers and laborers. Today it conjures up images of hearthealthy, cancer-free, long-lived people who understand the land, eat wonderful meals brimming with taste, and dance, drink, laugh, and love. Think Zorba the Greek meets Julia Child. A lot of popular writing implies that the foods that go into traditional diets have been carefully chosen over the years to promote good health. Thats not so. People ate what they could grow, gather, kill, or buy, and their choices were dictated by weather, geology, geography, economics, and even politics. Given these constraints, different cultures have developed various combinations of healthy (and sometimes not-so-healthy) foods.",

Also keep in mind that diets that seem to be good for people whose days are full of hard physical labor arent necessarily good for people who toil at a desk all day. In northern Europe, for example, the short growing season makes it difficult to eat fruits and vegetables year-round. It is, however, a fine climate for raising livestock, and meat and dairy foods made a good match for the energy needs of people who had to survive long, cold winters. In the small island nation of Japan, the main components of the diet are fish, naturally, and rice, a plant that can yield large amounts of grain from small plots of land. In both these cases the traditional diet kept people healthy long enough to reproduce and raise children and also to develop complex societies. Yet their successes dont imply that either of these diets would yield the best health for contemporary people who sit most of the day. THE MEDITERRANEAN DIET AND BEYOND In the 1950s and 1960s, pioneering nutrition researcher Ancel Keys and his colleagues looked at eating patterns in sixteen different populations in seven countries: Greece, Finland, Italy, the Netherlands, Yugoslavia, Japan, and the United States. This landmark work, known today as the Seven Countries Study, was the first major investigation of the link between diet and heart disease.",

One of the more intriguing findings was that people living in Crete, other parts of Greece, and southern Italy had very high adult life expectancies (the number of years the average forty-five-year-old can expect to live) and very low rates of heart disease and some cancers, all in spite of relatively limited medical systems.2 (See the tables on page 254.) At the time, the traditional diet in these Mediterranean countries was mostly plant-based foods: fruits, vegetables, breads, a variety of coarsely ground grains, beans, nuts, and seeds. Olive oil was the main source of dietary fat. People regularly ate dairy foodsmostly cheese and yogurtbut not in large amounts. Fish, poultry, and red meat were eaten on special occasions, not as part of the daily fare. People, usually men, often drank wine, but typically with meals. Keys concluded that the Mediterranean diet was an important reason for the low rates of heart disease in that region. Alarmed at the epidemic of heart disease that was hitting its peak in the United States in the 1960s, Keys and his wife, Margaret, began popularizing and promoting the Mediterranean diet in a series of bestselling books.3 Characteristics of Diets in the 1960s of Three Countries in the Seven Countries Study Diet Total fat ( energy) Saturated fat ( energy) Fruits and vegetables (gramsday) Legumes (gra",

Other thingssuch as the physically active lifestyle common throughout the region, the relatively low rates of overweight and obesity, or the low rates of smoking that prevailed until the late 1960scould have been among the causes. It was also possible that some genetic trait common among people in the Mediterranean region provided them with protection against heart disease and cancer, although this explanation was discounted by studies showing that people lose their protection when they migrate from countries where heart disease, cancer, and diabetes are rare to countries where they are common. Evidence accumulated over the last fifty years shows that Keys and his colleagues were on the right track. My research group, for example, has documented that the main elements of the Mediterranean lifestyle are connected with lower risks of many diseases even when followed by people living away from the Mediterranean region. Results from the Nurses Health Study document that heart disease rates in the United States could be reduced by least 80 percent by modest changes in diet and lifestyle changes.4 The Lyon Diet Heart Study, described in chapter five, showed that a group of heart attack survivors randomly assigned to a Mediterranean-type diet were 70 percent less likely to die over a two-year",

It was even recognized in the 2015 2020 Dietary Guidelines for Americans as an example of a desirable dietary pattern!7 But the Mediterranean diet isnt necessarily perfect. It evolved out of agricultural necessities imposed by a warm and semidry climate that, by chance, favored the growth of olive trees. And it isnt the only healthy culture-based diet. A traditional Japanese diet can be quite healthy. Traditional Latin American diets, which emphasize corn, beans, and vegetables, can provide another model of healthy eating. But keep in mind that the corn we eat today is not the same as the corn eaten one hundred years ago, and that large amounts of corn may not be healthy for individuals who arent physically active.

The low rates of heart disease and cancer among people who have eaten this type of diet for thousands of years are solid proof of that. The high rate of strokes in Japan, on the other hand, suggest that some aspect of that traditional diet, possibly high carbohydrate and salt intake combined with low consumption of healthy fats, protein, fruits, and vegetables, may not be so safe. TRADITIONAL DIETS CAN TRANSPLANT WELL While traditional diets may have health benefits for the cultures that shaped them, a big question is whether they offer similar benefits when transplanted somewhere else, like a modern society with relatively low levels of physical activity. If traditional diets are like weeds that can grow anywhere, then an Iowa accountant should get the same benefit from a Mediterranean diet as a Greek farmer. But if traditional diets are more like painstakingly bred orchids that grow only in carefully controlled environments, then adopting a traditional diet without also taking on the other aspects of the traditional culture wont necessarily make a dent in rates of heart disease, cancer, and other chronic diseases.",

Scientists, nutrition experts, and writers have often tried to condense the benefits of the Mediterranean or other traditional diets into one or two key elements, like olive oil or fiber or antioxidants. Thats a dangerous proposition. While we know that the Mediterranean diet helps prevent chronic disease, and that olive oil is one of the reasons why, just loading up on olive oil or taking high-dose antioxidant supplements isnt a substitute for a comprehensive healthy eating strategy. Most important, taking advantage of the Mediterranean diet isnt an all-ornothing proposition.

Following a healthy eating pattern is all about choices: picking good fats and steering clear of bad ones, adding more good sources of carbohydrate and cutting back on poor ones, opting for healthier protein packages, selecting smaller portions instead of super-sizing, and so on. Cost, along with taste and convenience, is an important factor influencing these choices. Foods that are filling, high in calories, and satisfying are often the least expensive.

Here are some suggestions for anyone interested in making healthy choices without breaking the bank. Fats. Theres no question that extra-virgin olive oil is more expensive than canola or soybean oil. Even so, you can find some perfectly tasty types for 8 to 10 a liter. At two tablespoons a day, thats less than 50 cents. From a health perspective, we cant say that olive oil is superior to canola or soybean oil. All are healthy fats, but we have longer-term experience with olive oil. Use olive oil where its flavor counts, such as for drizzling on vegetables or in salad dressings. Otherwise, use canola oil or other liquid plant oils for saut\u00e9ing or other applications where flavor isnt as important. Carbohydrates. White rice, pasta, and potatoes are some of the least expensive sources of carbohydrate.

When Americans think of protein, they tend to think of meat. Beef is certainly a major protein source. Turkey and chicken offer a more healthful protein package and are typically less expensive. Roasting a whole chicken is an inexpensive main dish that also offers plenty of leftover options. Fish is an even healthier protein source. Some types, such as swordfish and sole, are budget breakers or once-in-a-while luxuries. Others are more reasonably priced and are often on sale. These include tilapia, catfish, pollock, and many types of frozen fish. Canned tuna, salmon, and mackerelon a sandwich, in a salad, or as part of a casseroleare inexpensive ways to put fish on your plate.

Fruits and vegetables. Even though fruits and vegetables dont deliver the cheap caloric punch of fats and sugar, they can still be a good bargain. Consider whats in season when shopping, both for price and quality. The USDA calculates that a savvy shopper can meet the recommendations for fruits and vegetables in the 20152020 Dietary Guidelines for Americans for under 3 a day.10 My family has found that it is possible for much less. Vegetables that are quite inexpensive per serving include cabbage, winter squash, and carrots; with the right seasoning and oils, these are delicious. Frozen fruits and vegetables are just as nutritious as fresh ones, and often cost less. Out of season, dried fruit can be a good option. What you arent buying. Making healthier choices usually involves cutting back or cutting out foods such as steak, potato chips, ice cream, your morning doughnut, and sweetened sodas.

Many people pay part or all of the cost of their medications for these chronic conditions out of pocket. People who are overweight pay an average of 11 percent more in out-ofpocket medical costs than do people with healthy weights, while those who are obese have 26 percent higher out-of-pocket costs.

By reducing the environmental footprint of your diet, these choices can also convey a benefit to future generations. CHAPTER FOURTEEN Healthy Eating in Special Situations EATING WELL CAN HELP YOU stay healthy. Its just as important, maybe even more so, when you are experiencing something out of the ordinary, such as pregnancy, heart disease, diabetes, cancer, celiac disease, and other conditions. Each of us responds to health-related stresses in different ways. The recommendations that follow are general ones.

PREGNANCY During pregnancy, a woman needs extra nutrients for herself and her baby. That doesnt mean doubling up on food, what many call eating for two. It does mean perhaps getting a few more calories, extra amounts of a few vitamins and minerals, and at least enough of the rest. A healthy diet can supply almost all of these, with the possible exceptions of folate (folic acid) and iron. A special pregnancy diet isnt necessary. The basic eating pattern that I have described for good health will keep you and your baby healthy. That means eating real food: fruits, vegetables, whole grains, unsaturated fats, and healthy sources of protein. These deliver the energy, the raw materials, and the vitamins and minerals you and your baby need. Pregnancy creates a kind of metabolic stress test. Pregnancy-related high blood pressure and diabetes represent signals of potential problems. Adopting the overall healthy diet described in this book during pregnancyand ideally continuing it afterwardcan help reduce the risk of pregnancy-related high blood pressure and diabetes.

Beliefs about how much weight to gain during pregnancy have changed dramatically over the last fifty years. In 1970 the National Academy of Sciences Food and Nutrition Boards committee on maternal nutrition concluded that the desirable average gain is 24 pounds within a range of 20 to 25 pounds for all pregnant women regardless of their prepregnancy weight or body mass index.1 Today the recommended weight gain depends on a womans starting weight. For a woman whose weight is in the healthy range and who is having one baby, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists recommends a weight gain between 25 and 35 pounds during pregnancy. For a woman who is overweight, its 15 to 25 pounds. Its even less for obese women, 11 to 20 pounds.2 Discuss the best weight for you with your obstetriciangynecologist or midwife. PUTTING IT ALL TOGETHER The best way to get the vitamins and minerals you need during pregnancy is to follow a healthy diet and take a standard multivitamin-multimineral pill that delivers the recommended daily allowances for insurance against any dietary deficiencies in vitamins or minerals. Special prenatal supplements are available, but they can be priceyand many dont provide anything you cant get from a standard multivitamin.",

Dont rely on a multivitamin-multimineral as a substitute for a good diet, because it contains only a tiny fraction of the nutrients needed for a healthy pregnancy. Its especially important to get extra folate (also known as folic acid), a B vitamin that helps a babys brain and spinal cord develop properly. This vitamin is so important that all women of childbearing ageeven those who arent planning to get pregnantare urged to take 400 micrograms of folic acid a day, from either food or supplements, during their childbearing years.3 Thats because folic acid is needed most during the first thirty days after conception, a time when many women dont yet know they are pregnant. Some women have trouble taking prenatal vitamins or the extra iron supplements that are sometimes needed, because these can make morning sickness worse. Instead of skipping prenatal vitamins or iron, both of which a developing baby needs, taking these supplements later in the day or after eating can help. A developing baby needs a solid supply of omega-3 fats to make sure its brain, nervous system, eyes, and other tissues develop properly. The best way for pregnant women to get enough omega-3 fats is to eat seafood two or three times a week.

You need some pressure to move blood from the heart to the brain and the toes and back again. But too much pressure is harmful. It damages artery walls, which can lead to a heart attack or stroke. High blood pressure can weaken the heart muscle over time and damage other organs, like the kidneys and the eyes. About 90 percent of Americans develop high blood pressure during their lifetimes. Most people can keep their blood pressure in the healthy range by staying lean and physically active, consuming five or more servings of fruits and vegetables daily, and keeping salt intake low. If you have been diagnosed with high blood pressure (also known as hypertension), there are several things you can do to keep your blood pressure in check without the need for medication. And even if you do need medication, these strategies can help minimize the number of drugs needed to keep blood pressure under control, which in turn will reduce both the side effects you feel and the cost of your treatment. If you have high blood pressure and are overweight, losing just 5 to 10 percent of your starting weight can help lower your blood pressure and do much,",

Eating more fruits and vegetables delivers extra potassium, which helps control blood pressure. Aim for a minimum of five servings a day and remember: potatoes and corn dont count as vegetables. Cutting back on sodium (a main part of table salt) will also help you control your blood pressure. Try to keep your sodium intake under 1,500 milligrams, the amount in three-quarters of a teaspoon of salt. You dont need to count milligrams of salt on a meal-by-meal basis, but it is helpful to know where most of your salt comes from, particularly because so much of it is hidden in processed and prepared foods (see Hidden Salt in Food on page 230). For that reason, I have included information about sodium in the recipes in chapter fifteen. Suddenly decreasing the amount of salt (sodium) may make your diet seem bland. But if you cut back slowly, you wont notice that you are taking in less salt. Most natural foods are low in sodium, so if you limit your intake of processed foods and dont load up on salt when cooking, your sodium intake will be low without your thinking about it. Keeping your blood pressure in check, whether by diet or drugs, is an important way to protect yourself from having a heart attack or stroke.",

Another 86 million have its precursor, prediabetes. Many people have diabetes for years without knowing it. Early on, diabetes causes few if any symptoms. But years of high blood sugar eventually cause trouble. In the United States, diabetes is the leading cause of aging-related vision loss and blindness. Its the reason why more than 70,000 Americans a year have a foot or part of a leg amputated. It contributes to heart attacks and damages nerves in the feet and hands. Maintaining a healthy weight by diet and exercise is the most important way to prevent diabetes and to treat it after it appears. Some individuals with type 2 diabetes are able to control their blood sugar by losing weight, exercising, and following a diet that focuses on vegetables, fruits, unsaturated fats, whole grains, and healthy sources of protein such as fish, poultry, and nuts, and by not eating foods made with rapidly digested carbohydrates or added sugars. Dietary recommendations for diabetes have evolved over the last few years. They once focused on eating as few carbohydrates as possible, then moved in the direction of the ill-advised low-fat, high-carbohydrate eating pattern. Several recent studies have shown that individuals can better control type 2 diabetes when they cut back on some carbohydrate-rich foods, especial",

Several recent studies have shown that individuals can better control type 2 diabetes when they cut back on some carbohydrate-rich foods, especially rapidly digested carbs, and eat foods that deliver unsaturated fats instead. Eating foods that are low on the glycemic index (see The Glycemic Index: How Carbohydrates Affect Your Body Sugar on page 116) and high in fiber, such as intact whole grains and beans, can help control diabetes. And because people with diabetes are at high risk of having a heart attack or stroke, its especially important for them to eat less saturated fat and more unsaturated fat. In other words, the healthy eating patterns Ive laid out in this book are particularly valuable for individuals with diabetes. Overall caloric intakeeating only as much as you burn so you dont gain weightis even more important for people with diabetes than it is for the rest of us. As described in chapter four, the healthy eating patterns I have set out make weight control easier than focusing just on calories. Since everyone is a bit different, its a good idea to talk with your health care provider before choosing the diet thats right for you.

High LDL cholesterol is largely driven by diet, except in the minority of people predisposed to high LDL because of their genetic makeup. A healthy diet can help prevent the emergence of high LDL cholesterol or beat it back if it does appear. For years, the American Heart Association and others told people with high cholesterol to lower their intake of fat, especially saturated fat. But that has only a small effect on cholesterol. All too often, the diet is then declared a failure and people are simply put on drugs, usually a cholesterol-lowering statin. In the chapters and recipes in this book, I have emphasized a broad approach of replacing saturated and trans fats with monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats, eating whole grains instead of high-glycemic carbohydrates and sugars, weight control, and regular physical activity. This strategy can help you control your cholesterol and greatly reduce your risk of heart disease, even with medication. Statins have gained a glowing reputation as drugs that stop heart disease. Thats only partly true. Theres no question that they can dramatically lower the amount of harmful LDL in the bloodstream. They reduce the risk of heart attack by about one-third.

You can do more to prevent heart attack, stroke, and other chronic conditions by taking full advantage of the healthy eating strategies covered in this book, which work to protect your health in multiple ways besides lowering your cholesterol. HEART ATTACK AND STROKE Heart attacks, angina, stroke, and other cardiovascular conditions affect millions of Americans, although today they tend to appear at later ages than they did in the 1950s and 1960s. Most cases of these, as I have demonstrated in this book, can be prevented by diet and lifestyle choices. Even after a heart attack or stroke, following the Harvard Healthy Eating Plate and the Healthy Eating Pyramid can dramatically reduce your risk of having another one. You dont need to completely reverse the damage that has been wrought to your blood vessels; you just need to stop it from getting worse.

This doesn't mean we shouldnt take statinsonly that relying on them and not taking advantage of the full benefit of diet and lifestyle is a serious and often fatal mistake. CANCER A somewhat daunting discovery from the last decade of research is that cancer isnt one disease. It is hundreds of diseases, each with its own triggers and treatments. That means there isnt a single treat cancer diet. The number one strategy to prevent cancer is not smoking or using other forms of tobacco. Its closely followed by maintaining a healthy weight. Being overweight or obese increases the risk of many cancers, including cancers of the breast, colon, endometrium, and pancreas. Because smoking is on the decline and overweightobesity on the rise, excess weight now causes almost as many cancer deaths in the United States as smoking does. For years a low-fat diet was promoted as the best way to prevent cancer. But that advice hasnt been supported by large cohort studies and randomized trials. Eating more fruits and vegetables, and less red meat will reduce the risk of some types of cancer, as will limiting alcohol consumption, if consumed at all (see chapter nine).",

These days, earlier diagnosis and better treatment mean that most people do not die from their cancers but instead often die from heart disease, stroke, or something else. Because of this, the healthy eating strategies described in this book have been linked to overall survival for people with cancer. CELIAC DISEASE If you have celiac disease, you know the problems that even a few crumbs of bread can cause: gas, bloating, abdominal cramps, diarrhea, and more. The cause is gluten, a mixture of proteins found mainly in wheat, rye, and barley. People with celiac disease cant tolerate gluten. For some reason, their immune systems see gluten as a foreign invader. Over time, the attack on gluten damages the lining of the small intestine, leading to weight loss, skin rashes, osteoporosis, infertility, nerve damage, seizures, and more. People with celiac disease must do everything they can to avoid foods that contain gluten.

Even so, it can lurk in unexpected foods such as soy sauce, french fries, processed meats, prepared soups and sauces, and herbal supplements. As I described in Gluten in Grains: A Danger for Some on page 130, a related condition, called gluten sensitivity or non-celiac gluten sensitivity, can generate symptoms similar to celiac disease but without the intestinal damage. If you need to go gluten free, or decide to do it, try to find new ways to get folic acid, other B vitamins, and dietary fiber, which the bowels need to work properly. You can do this by eating fruits, vegetables, beans, and non-gluten grains such as brown rice or quinoa. DEPRESSION Many people are afflicted with depression at some point in their lifetimes.

This isnt surprising, because coffee has long been known to have mild moodelevating effects. We also found that consumption of flavonoid-containing fruits and vegetables, especially citrus fruits and juices, was associated with lower risk of depression.6 In spite of intense interest in the possibility that higher intake of omega-3 fats might prevent depression, the evidence for this is weak. Some researchers have hypothesized that higher dietary intakes of omega-6 fatty acids, found in many plant oils like soybean and corn oil, could increase the risk of depression by boosting inflammation throughout the body. But higher intake of omega-6 fats may actually reduce inflammation.7 In our investigation of suicide risk, we saw no evidence of a reduction in suicide with a higher intake of omega-3 fats or lower intake of omega-6 fats.8 MEMORY LOSS Because the average American is living longerthanks mainly to reductions in smoking, improvements in diet, and earlier diagnosis and better treatments of medical conditionsage-related memory loss (dementia) is an increasing burden on individuals and family members.",

There is exciting evidence that a Mediterranean-type dietary pattern can reduce the risk of memory loss and slow the course of this process. This isnt completely surprising, because the factors that lead to memory loss and dementia include damage to the brains blood supply and the occurrence of multiple small strokes. A poor diet may also promote processes in the brain related to Alzheimers disease, a common form of dementia. Both cardiovascular disease and Alzheimers disease develop slowly over many decades, providing major opportunities for prevention by diet. A Mediterranean-type diet pattern is proven to reduce these and other forms of cardiovascular disease. But even once memory loss has begun, slowing its progression through diet can be valuable.

Foods linked to poorer thinking skills included red meat, fast fried food, pastries, and sweets. Sound familiar? Morris created a score based on these foods, which she called the MIND diet score, and tested it in a group of almost 1,000 older men and women taking part in the Memory and Aging Project at Rush University Medical Center in Chicago. Over a five-year period, higher MIND scoresmeaning healthier eatingwere associated with better scores on thinking and memory tests.10 As is the case for cardiovascular disease, the strong benefit of the MIND dietary pattern likely comes from multiple foods, not a single nutrient.

Your tastes may eventually start shifting away from salty, sugary, overprocessed foods and wake up to a whole wonderful world of fresh, clean flavors. Who knows, your list of favorites might just change completely. This section also includes a weeks worth of menus to help you get started planning healthful meals. CHOOSE NUTRITION-PACKED FOODS While there are no superfoods that contain every single nutrient needed for good health, some foods pack more nutrients per calorie than others. By choosing nutrient-dense foods, the overall quality of your diet will improve practically overnight. For the most part, that means eating whole grains, fruits, and vegetables at every meal. Here are some tips to get you started. Add dark leafy greens to salads. Dark leafy greens contain more nutrients than iceberg lettuce. Spinach, kale, and romaine lettuce, for example, contain everything from iron to folate to fiber. Iceberg lettuce, on the other hand, is mostly water. A good rule of thumb: The darker the green, the more nutrients a leafy vegetable contains. Sprinkle wheat germ on cereals, casseroles, or yogurt. Adding 2 tablespoons of wheat germ boosts the fiber nearly 2 grams but adds only 51 calories. Use the toasted variety for a nuttier flavor. Serve a whole grain as a side dish instead of potatoes.",

But the potatoes have nowhere near as much fiber and are not as nutrient dense as whole grains. In addition, the body quickly turns the starch in white potatoes into sugar, causing a quick spike in blood sugar and insulin. Whole grains are digested more slowly, causing a lower and more even rise in blood sugar. Snack on whole-grain crackers rather than those made with processed flour. Wholegrain crackers such as Triscuit or Ak-mak contain more fiber than those made with refined flour. That fiber can add up if youre a regular snacker. Even better, think of nuts as an alternative. They are probably the healthiest hunger-blunting snack you could have. Try the three pleasures for dessert instead of ice cream or cake. Instead of a traditional calorie-laden dessert, create one from three of the healthiest foods you can eat: fruit, nuts, and dark chocolate. This offers a sweet, delicious way to end a meal thats also good for your health and your waistline. When Gail and I have dessert at home, this is usually what we make.

But the overall quality of your diet the kinds of foods you choose to eat day in and day outdoes have a major impact. Good diets, ones that promote well-being, are built mainly on nutrientdense choices: foods that contain healthful fats, fiber, and a whole host of other nutrients and phytochemicals. I urge you to enjoy food. But when push comes to shove, make choices that are high in flavor and good for health. One important step is to replace unhealthy saturated and trans fats with healthful unsaturated fats (see Replacing Unhealthy Fats with Healthier Ones on page 106).

But somewhere along the way most of us have lost touch with their goodness. Heres a brief overview of whole and intact grains, an A-to-Z list with what you need to know about cooking techniques, storage guidelines, and taste. Remember, whole grains are unrefined but can be available as flour; intact grains are just that. Intact Grain Versus Whole Grain Grains are the seeds of plants that are mostly in the grass family. Each intact grain has three parts: the bran, the germ, and the endosperm. The bran surrounds the grain. It provides protection so the seed can endure harsh conditions and still germinate many months or years later. Even though the brain is mostly indigestible fiber, many minerals and vitamins are closely attached to it. The germ is the embryonic plant that will sprout and grow when the temperature and moisture conditions are right. The delicate living tissues in the germ are bathed in unsaturated oil, which also contains a large amount of fat-soluble antioxidants, such as vitamin E, to protect the oil from becoming oxidized. The endosperm provides energy for the germinating seed until it can begin to make its own food through photosynthesis. It is mainly starch. Over the years, grains have been bred to grow larger and larger endosperms, meaning more and more starch.",

Intact grains are grains that have been minimally processed to remove them from the seed head and to remove grit and other impurities. They have not been smashed, pulverized, steamed, or undergone other processing. Examples of intact grains include wheat berries, brown rice, millet, oat groats, and quinoa. Whole grains, and foods made from them, are intact grains that have been processed in one way or another, often by milling, which grinds up the grain. They still contain the bran, germ, and endosperm. In contrast, refined grains such as wheat flour (not whole wheat flour), have had the bran and germ removed. Vitamins and minerals are often added to this depleted flour, which is then sold as enriched flour. While that may sound healthy, whats added is only a small fraction of the many nutrients and phytochemicals that the original grain contained. Whole grains are significantly better for you than refined grains because they deliver all the nutrients that were in the intact grain. But they arent as good as intact grains. One reason is that milling chops up the grains, disrupting the bran layer. It no longer covers the endosperm, opening it up to faster attack by starch-digesting enzymes. This speeds the conversion of starch to blood sugar.",

Grinding the endosperm into fine particles also makes it easier for starch-digesting enzymes to do their job. The result is that intact grains have a lower glycemic index (see page 117), which results in slower and lower rises in blood glucose, less demand for insulin, and lower risk of type 2 diabetes. The lower glycemic index of intact grains helps you feel full longer after a meal or snack and delays the onset of hunger. Amaranth Cultivated by the Aztecs, this yellow-gold seed has a crunchy texture that softens only slightly when cooked. In fact, its creamy-crunchy texture is so much like the consistency of hot cereals that this is the way the grain is most often eaten. For the adventurous, amaranth (pronounced AM-uh-ranth) can be tucked into baked goods (see Banana-Apricot Nut Bread, page 306) or mixed with other grains to make a pilaf or casserole. Try toasting the seeds in a dry skillet; they expand and pop just like corn. Sprinkle the crunchy popped kernels on salads, vegetables, and pizza. Cooking rating: Easy but time-consuming. Amaranth must be simmered in a large amount of water (1 part grain to 3 parts water) for twenty-five to thirty minutes to eat as cereal. To use in baked goods, presoak in boiling water.

The pearled variety is the most common and most versatile. It retains a chewy texture even after long periods of cooking. That makes it a good candidate for soups, casseroles, and even a whole-grain risotto (see Wild MushroomBarley Risotto, page 367). Cooking rating: Easy but time-consuming.

But the grain can be ground and dried and made into grits, cornmeal, flour, and pasta. The less its processed, the more flavor and nutrients it will contain. Cooking rating: Very easy. Cornmeal: Regular (degerminated) cornmeal is made by stripping dried corn kernels of their outer husk and the germ, which causes loss of nutrients. However, it is usually enriched with some of these lost nutrients. The grain is then ground into a fine, medium, or coarse texture. Polenta is made from a coarse-grain cornmeal. Finely ground cornmeal is called corn flour; masa harina is a type of corn flour used to make corn tortillas. Look for the stone-ground variety if possible, as it contains more nutrients than other varieties of cornmeal. Note that degerminated cornmeal is not whole grain.

Wheat berries come in soft and hard varieties, but the soft and hard moniker has nothing to do with tenderness. The difference between the two varieties is gluten (protein) content. Soft wheat is low in gluten and is ground into pastry flour. Hard wheat is high in gluten and is ground into regular or hearty flours. Very nutty in flavor, cooked wheat berries make a wonderful breakfast cereal or a crunchy addition to breads and baked goods. They even make a chewy-crunchy substitute for pasta in cold salads. Cooking rating: Easy but time-consuming. Wheat berries must be simmered for thirty minutes or so. They can be toasted in the oven or in a dry skillet beforehand to shorten the cooking time. Nutritional benefits: Cholesterol-free and high in fiber; 16 percent of calories from protein. Small amounts of minerals, including iron and zinc. Shopping tip: Wheat berries can be found in specialty or whole-food grocery stores. Wild Rice Technically not a type of rice but the seed of an aquatic grass, this grain rates attention for its stellar fiber content, not to mention an intensely nutty flavor.

Quality can vary, with the more expensive brands typically having a larger percentage of well-shaped, uncrushed grains. Use more expensive varieties in dishes where appearance is important and less expensive ones in soups or stuffings. Steer clear of instant varieties: they may save you time but dont look quite so appetizing. Cooking rating: Easy but time-consuming. Wild rice must be simmered for 40 to 45 minutes. Nutritional benefits: Wild rice contains more protein than brown rice. Its a good source of vitamins A, C, and E, as well as phosphorus, zinc, and folate. Shopping tip: Wild rice can be found in specialty or whole-food grocery stores but is also showing up in mainstream grocery stores. Whole-Grain Cooking and Storage Tips Here are some general points to keep in mind when storing and cooking whole grains.  Soaking intact whole grains, either for just a few hours or overnight, helps reduce cooking time.  Toasting whole grains intensifies their nutty flavor. Toasting can also reduce the cooking time for some grains, including barley, spelt, wheat berries, and oat groats.  Cooking times arent carved in stone. Grains, like legumes, may cook faster or slower depending on how long they have been in storage. Just-harvested grains cook quicker than grains that have been stored for a long time. Tenderness is the best measure of doneness.",

Store whole grains in airtight containers, preferably in the refrigerator. All whole grains carry small amounts of natural oils, which can spoil quickly, particularly during hot weather.  Cooked whole grains will keep in the refrigerator for two to three days. They also freeze well. So you might want to consider simmering large batches of grains and packaging them for the freezer. That way you can pull them out and drop them in a soup, a casserole, or a salad without investing a lot of time in the kitchen. FILLING THE HEALTHY SHOPPING BAG Now that youre committed to eating more whole grains, fresh produce, unsaturated fats, and healthy protein packages, chances are your shopping list has a few new additions. And you may have questions about where and how to find these foods. Will you need to make routine pilgrimages to specialty stores? How do organic foods fit into the overall picture? Which whole-food products taste best? These questions arent difficult to answer, but they do involve some individual preference. The organic issue, for example, has more to do with personal choice than nutrition. There is no evidence that organic produce, grains, or meat are nutritionally superior to produce and grains grown by traditional farming methods.1 The key difference is what other things they containor dont contain like pesticides and antibiotics.",

Organic foods come out on top in that category because they are grown without pesticides and antibiotics. If you decide to make a commitment to organic foods, keep in mind that these products are not always widely available. One of the best strategies is to consider locally grown produce. When you shop at a local farmers market, farm stand, or small supermarket that carries local produce, youll be rewarded by some of the best-tasting fruits and vegetables around, organic or not. Produce that is shipped from long distances may have lost some of its flavor or nutritional value because it can take many days to reach the supermarket. Locally grown fruits and vegetables, picked at the height of ripeness, have incredible flavors and nutrition profiles. So, rather than look for asparagus to make the Asparagus, Tofu, Shiitake, and Cashew Stir-Fry (page 336) in July when its out of season, find a vegetable thats being harvested. Green beans are a summertime crop; they can make a nice stand-in for asparagus in the stir-fry recipe. Learn to cook with the seasons. Youll be rewarded with fruits and vegetables that are at their flavor and nutritional peak. Also, keep in mind that organic doesnt equate with healthy.

As for whole-grain products, locating them is now a lot easier than it used to be. Many whole-grain foods are now firmly entrenched in regular supermarkets. Look for them either in a special aisle with organic and health foods or in the regular flour, cereal, and ricepasta aisles. Owing to a burgeoning interest in whole foods, the natural-food sections of many supermarkets are growing larger, and whole-food markets are becoming a familiar option in many cities. Then theres the Internet. Many of the larger companies that market whole-grain products have comprehensive websites and efficient mail-order systems. Many company websites have a store locator or Where to Find button that lets you locate nearby stores that sell their products. Splurge on Quality Ingredients Eating healthy doesnt mean that food has to be less satisfying. Learn what chefs have known all along: a little bit of a high-quality ingredient goes a long way toward boosting flavor. A good-quality flavored vinegar (balsamic, sherry) can make a potent vinaigrette.

Nutrition Facts Label The nutrition facts label gives a detailed accounting of how a serving of the food rates nutritionally, first by providing information about calorie content and key nutrients and then by comparing that information to reference values or standard requirements. In 2016, the FDA updated the food label to make it easier for consumers to make better informed food choices.  Serving size. Dont lose sight of this amount. All the other information on the panel is meaningless if you cant put portion size into perspective. Unfortunately, the portion size listed is often far smaller than what most people might eat. For example, an oversize cookie may list the calories and fat for onefifth of the cookie as a serving rather than list calories, fat, and nutrients for the whole cookie. Or what looks like a single-serving entr\u00e9e of frozen lasagna, upon closer inspection, turns out to be 2.5 servings.  Calories. Calories count.

This is one number you shouldnt have trouble with, not if youre searching out whole grains, fruits, and vegetablesall foods that are cholesterolfree. Keep in mind that the American Heart Association recommends eating less than 300 milligrams of cholesterol per day.  Sodium. Look to this section of the food label if you need to restrict salt or sodium in your diet. General guidelines encourage 1,2001,300 milligrams of sodium per day, with an upper limit of 2,300 milligrams (about the amount found in 1 teaspoon of salt).  Total carbohydrates. Rather than live by numbers, its best to emphasize whole grains. A listing of the grams of sugar and grams of fiber helps put into context the type of carbohydrate the food contains.

Daily values. The old label listed vitamins A and C, calcium, and iron. The new one lists vitamin D, calcium, iron, and potassium. Keep in mind that its based on a person who requires two thousand calories per day. That means your needs may be different if youre eating fewer calories or your energy requirements are higher. Ingredient List This item-by-item list offers the most detailed accounting of what a product contains. While it doesnt give exact amounts of each ingredient, it does list them in descending order by weight. At the top of the list is the main or most predominant ingredient. Say youre looking at a juice drink label. The first two ingredients might be water and high-fructose corn syrup. Farther down the list, about three or four ingredients later, a fruit juice like grape or apple might be mentioned.

STOCKING A HEALTHY KITCHEN Here are some tips for items youll want to have on hand for your healthy kitchen: Produce Whenever possible, choose locally grown fruits and vegetables. Aim for a variety of colors, from red and orange peppers through green kale and spinach to purple plums. The more choices the better: no single food provides all of the nutrients you need to be healthy. Grains Once youve used up the white rice in your pantry, replace it with whole grains such as barley, bulgur, millet, quinoa, and more. If your grocery store sells grain in bulk bins, buy small amounts of unfamiliar ones to discover delicious new choices that are often simple to prepare. Keep in mind that whole grains, particularly if milled, can lose their freshness and become rancid if stored at room temperature too long. Keeping them in the refrigerator or freezer will greatly lengthen their shelf life. Fats and Oils Stock your pantry with olive oil plus one or more of the following: canola, sunflower, corn, soybean, and peanut oil. Use these oils to saut\u00e9 vegetables, to stirfry fish or chicken, and as the base of salad dressings. At the table, try dipping bread into olive oil or drizzling oil onto the bread instead of using butter or margarine.",

ONE WEEK OF MENUS To give you some idea of how meals might shape up when youre dining according to the Healthy Eating Pyramid and Healthy Eating Plate, Ive developed a sample week of menus. These Monday-through-Sunday food plans are meant simply as a guideline, one that illustrates how to put into practice the principles talked about in the preceding chapters. Each days menu is based on 2,000 calories, the reference figure that health professionals and the food industry use as a benchmark for the energy needs of the average American. Granted, not every individual needs exactly 2,000 calories each day. Most of us have varying energy needs based on age, size, activity level, and how effectively we burn energy. But this figure is a good starting point. No doubt youll want to make adjustments to these meal plans based on your own needs.

We havent built alcohol into these daily menus; if you are drinking a glass of wine or beer with your evening meal, you will need to figure in an additional 100 to 200 calories a day. Rather than agonize over daily calorie numbers, however, think about your current situation. Are you maintaining a healthy weight? If you are, then youre no doubt eating the right amount of food for you. Look to these menu plans to guide you in the direction of healthy food choices, letting your natural instincts guide portion size. If you need to lose weight, follow the 1,600-calorie plan or just begin cutting back on what you currently eat. Weight will come off naturally as you begin to cut back and become more active.

Recipes Busy Day Menu It isnt always easy to combine healthy eating with an intense work schedule and busy family life. Heres how I try to do it on busy days, a plan that can be varied in an almost infinite number of ways. Wake up, boil water, and dump in steel-cut oats or a packet of Kashi pilaf, a mix of intact oats, brown rice, wheat, and other grains. While this is cooking, I exercise. When the grains are almost done, I add dried fruit or fresh fruit in season and some nuts plus a bit of yogurt on top. Orange juice diluted with carbonated water provides fresh-tasting but low-calorie hydration at breakfast. With this breakfast Im never hungry before noon, so a snack never enters my mind. (For days with early meetings, Kashi can be cooked the night before.) Leftover Kashi provides the beginning of a lunch that can be prepared in five minutes. To a base of Kashi in a glass or plastic container, add whatever sounds good. It might be a salad or a mix of fruits or leftover bits of chicken or fish. Most of the time I also add one or more types of nuts. A few generous dashes of a flavorful olive oil with vinegar or a seasoning make almost any of these endless combinations ta",

My favorite is when our peaches, blueberries, and grapes are all ripe at the same time: with roasted almonds and olive oil, this is hard to beat. Snap on a cover and slip it in a bag with an apple, fork, and napkin; this is quicker than waiting in a cafeteria line. I put all this in my backpack, dash out the door with my bike, and Im in my office in the Harvard Medical area in fifteen minutes, faster than I can get there by driving and parking. In the evening, if Im lucky, my wife, Gail, may have made one of the entr\u00e9es from this book, or one of countless other healthy creations, for dinner. If not, a stop at the fish market provides a quick beginning for a meal. Broil with some lemon, add a salad and maybe some whole-grain bread with a little olive oil for dipping, and in fifteen minutes we can have a fresh, satisfying, and healthy meal.

These griddle cakes derive their sweetness solely from the dates in the filling, and with the pleasant crunch of semolina, they are a lovely surprise for Sunday breakfast. Any leftovers are also delicious with afternoon tea or midmorning coffee. Made with a combination of high-protein durum wheat semolina and whole wheat flour, they are a healthy antidote to more conventional pancakes and need no infusion of syrup to make them tasty.",

Note: Bone-in chicken thighs are used in this recipe because they remain moist and have a longer cooking time, permitting flavors to develop fully. Boneless thighs are an option, but the cooking time will be shorter. If chicken breasts are substituted, they should be pounded to a uniform thickness because their irregular shape prevents uniform cooking. The skin is removed from all because the moist heat in this recipe results in poor texture and flavor. Average chicken thighs weigh about 6 ounces, yielding 212 to 3 ounces of meat after removing the bone and skin.

    "content": "(FAST FIX) This spicy fish takes its flavor cues from India, where savory and sweet spices are blended and used on every thing from meat to vegetables to seafood. The tuna is marinated briefly in the tandoori spice mixture and then cooked in a skillet. Fix some citrus-flavored couscous as a side dish. 4 (5-ounce) tuna steaks, about 12-inch thick 34 cup pineapple juice 1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice 1 tablespoon minced fresh ginger 1 tablespoon minced fresh garlic 1 tablespoon ground coriander 1 tablespoon paprika 112 teaspoons ground cumin 1 teaspoon coarse salt 1 teaspoon cumin seed 1 teaspoon chili garlic sauce 14 teaspoon ground cinnamon 18 teaspoon ground cloves 1 tablespoon canola or other oil 1. Combine all the ingredients except the oil in a large zip-top bag. Press the air out of the bag and seal; refrigerate for 15 minutes, turning once or twice. 2. In a large cast-iron or nonstick skillet, heat the oil over medium heat. Remove the tuna from the marinade; discard the marinade. Place the tuna in the hot skillet; cook for 4 to 5 minutes on each side or until cooked to your liking. Note: Tuna can be grilled or broiled. Prepare a grill or preheat the broiler. Brush the tuna with the oil and cook as directed above. Look for chili garlic sauce in the Asian section of most supermarkets.

Sprinkle each fillet with salt and black pepper and place the fish on top of the vegetables. 3. Combine the remaining 1 tablespoon oil, the lemon juice, and the oregano in a small bowl.",

Heres a version of that popular dish made with brown rice, which is easier to find and higher in fiber than the rice noodles. The secret to making a great fried rice is to cook the rice the night before and to use a little bit less liquid than is called for on the package directions.

Taste often as it is cooking, you want it to be toothsome and retain structure. Remove from the heat, drain any excess water, and set aside. 3. While the farro is cooking, on a rimmed baking sheet toss the squash, onion, and thyme with the olive oil, vinegar, and a couple big pinches of salt. Arrange in a single layer and roast for about 20 minutes. Toss the squash and onion every 5 to 7 minutes to get browning on all sides. Remove from the oven, let cool a bit, and mince just half of the red onions. 4. In a large bowl, gently toss everything except the goat cheese with the walnut oil. Taste and add a bit of salt if necessary. Serve family-style in a simple bowl or on a platter, garnished with the goat cheese.

People of African descent have been cooking with greens for centuries. In Southern cooking, greens are usually slow-cooked and flavored with pork. In Oldwayss A Taste of African Heritage cooking program, we show students that cooking greens can be quick and healthy, using lemon juice and mustard as flavor-enhancing meat substitutes. 2 bunches collard greens (about 312 pounds) 1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil 1 medium yellow onion, diced 4 garlic cloves, minced 1 tablespoon Dijon mustard Juice of 14 lemon Salt 1. Stem the collards and cut the leaves into long, thin strips. 2. In a large skillet, heat the olive oil over medium heat. Add the onion and the garlic and cook, stirring, for 2 to 3 minutes, until the onion is golden. 3. Add the mustard and lemon juice to the skillet and stir to combine. 4. Add the greens to the skillet and toss to coat. Season with salt and add a splash of water to slightly moisten the greens.

Adapted from Vegetable Heaven (Hyperion, 1997). This is a great way to get some of those bitter greens into your diet, because the sweet onions and tart cherries balance out the favor. The result is surprisingly smooth. I like to use a mixture of collards, red mustard, arugula, and a little kale. The amount of greens might seem enormous, but dont forget that they will cook way down. Unsweetened sour cherries from a can work beautifully here, but if you have access to fresh sour cherries (and you have a good pitting gadget), by all means use them. Vidalia onions are terrific, but if you cant find them, just use regular ones. This dish gives off a lot of cooking liquid, but it is too pretty and delicious to let evaporate. So just include some with each serving, especially if you are pairing this dish with pasta or rice. 1 cup fresh sour cherries, pitted, or canned unsweetened sour cherries, drained 2 to 3 teaspoons sugar 1 tablespoon canola oil 3 cups sliced sweet yellow onions, such as Vidalia (about 2 large) A few shakes of salt (optional) 3 large bunches fresh greens, stemmed, if necessary, and c",

Knowing that foods can be enjoyable without destroying our health, it occurred to me that three of the healthiest foods we know are fruit, nuts, and dark chocolate. So I started asking our waiters if they had a creative chef. Of course they all said yes. To which I responded, thats great, and asked to have the chef put together a combination of fruit, nuts, dark chocolate, and nothing more in a creative way.",

    "content": ", thats great, and asked to have the chef put together a combination of fruit, nuts, dark chocolate, and nothing more in a creative way. Almost always Ive gotten something delicious. Some of these were works of art, some were elegantly laid out on a plate, and some were simply offered in a bowl. Sometimes the chocolate was a syrup, sometimes chopped pieces. I was never seriously disappointed, and I suspect that most chefs enjoy a little challenge beyond their routine. Given this experience, I thought the dessert deserved a name. At a dinner with my colleague Frank Hu and our wives, we decided to call this Three Pleasures. I like this name because it conveys enjoyment, not decadence, from both the sensual experience of eating three wonderful foods and also from the knowledge that we have respected the bodies that we have been given. Do try ordering Three Pleasures. I hope that restaurants will start to put it on their menus. To see some stunning examples prepared by a variety of chefs, visit The Nutrition Source (www.hsph.harvard.edunutritionsource20160711dessert-by-design-threepleasures). Because of the many types of fruits, nuts, and chocolates, the ways to create Three Simple Pleasures are almost endless. If fresh fruit is not available, dried fruit can work quite well (think dates, currants, and cranberries). A Fourth Pleasure is also an option: a sprinkle of a quality spirit such as bourbon, rum, port, or rye can add another delightful dimension.",
